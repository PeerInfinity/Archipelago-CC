## No known helper issues at this time

The helper functions appear to be implemented in `frontend/modules/shared/gameLogic/pokemon_emerald/pokemon_emeraldLogic.js`.

All standard HM functions are implemented:
- can_cut

- can_rock_smash
- can_strength
- can_surf
- can_fly
- can_dive
- can_waterfall
- has_badges
- has_group_unique

Will update this file if helper issues are discovered during testing.
