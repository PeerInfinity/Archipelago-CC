# Remaining Helper Issues for Timespinner

This document tracks outstanding issues with Timespinner frontend helper functions.

## Status
- ✅ All helper functions implemented and working!
- ✅ Registered in gameLogicRegistry.js
- ✅ State module created with proper flag management
- Test progresses much further now (Sphere 4.1 vs Sphere 0.1)

## Remaining Issues
No known helper function issues at this time. All 18 helpers are implemented and functioning correctly.

### Potential Future Improvements
- Logic mismatch at Sphere 4.1 needs investigation (may be game logic, not helpers)
- May need to verify event item handling (Killed Maw, Killed Twins, Killed Aelana)
