# Remaining Exporter Issues for Timespinner

This document tracks outstanding issues with the Timespinner game exporter.

## Status
- ✅ All core exporter issues resolved!
- ✅ Variable resolution working (`flooded`, `logic`)
- ✅ All helpers implemented and working
- Test now progresses to Sphere 4.1 (was failing at Sphere 0.1)

## Remaining Issues
No known exporter issues at this time. The exporter is successfully:
- Resolving `flooded` variable to `precalculated_weights`
- Resolving `logic.flag_*` attributes to boolean constants
- Exporting all helper function references correctly
