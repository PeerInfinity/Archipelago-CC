# Super Metroid - Remaining Exporter Issues

No major exporter issues at this time. The exporter has been created and generation succeeds.

## Status
- ✅ Created basic exporter at `exporter/games/sm.py`
- ✅ Generation runs successfully
- The exporter inherits from GenericGameExportHandler

The rules are complex due to Super Metroid's custom SMBoolManager system, but these are not exporter issues - they are helper issues (see remaining-helper-issues.md).
