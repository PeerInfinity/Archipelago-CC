# Overcooked! 2 - Remaining Helper Issues

## No helper issues identified yet

The helper functions currently implemented appear to be correct:
- `has_enough_stars`: Correctly counts Star + Bonus Star items
- `has_requirements_for_level_star`: Correctly checks exclusive and additive requirements from level_logic
- `meets_requirements`: Correctly validates requirement objects

Helper issues may be discovered after the exporter issues are fixed.
