# Remaining Celeste 64 Helper Issues

No helper-specific issues identified yet. The helper functions (location_rule, region_connection_rule, goal_rule) exist and are defined in:
- frontend/modules/shared/gameLogic/celeste64/celeste64Logic.js

These helpers will be tested once the rule engine issues are fixed.
