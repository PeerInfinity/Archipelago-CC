# Remaining Helper Issues for Castlevania 64

This document tracks unresolved issues with the Castlevania 64 helper functions (`frontend/modules/shared/gameLogic/cv64/cv64Logic.js`).

## Status

Last test run: 2025-11-14
Test result: PASSED (seed 1)

## Issues

None currently. The CV64 spoiler test for seed 1 passed successfully with no helper issues detected.

Note: There were many log messages about `location_item_name` helper being called, but these did not cause test failures. The helper appears to be functioning correctly for the tested seed.
