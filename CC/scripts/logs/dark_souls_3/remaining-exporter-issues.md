# Remaining Exporter Issues

## Issue: Item export warning (may not be critical)
- Warning message: "Handler for Dark Souls III returned no item data. Item export might be incomplete."
- Despite this warning, items appear to be exported correctly in the rules.json file
- Needs investigation if tests continue to fail
