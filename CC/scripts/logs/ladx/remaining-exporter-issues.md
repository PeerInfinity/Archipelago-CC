# Remaining Exporter Issues for Links Awakening DX

This file tracks outstanding issues with the exporter (exporter/games/ladx.py) that need to be fixed.

## Issues

**None!** All exporter issues have been resolved.

## Recently Fixed

1. **COUNT and FOUND LADXR condition types**: Added support for COUNT(item, amount) and FOUND(item, amount) condition types that check item counts. The Rooster Cave entrance now correctly requires 2 Power Bracelets (COUNT(POWER_BRACELET, 2)).
