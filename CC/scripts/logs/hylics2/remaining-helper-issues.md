# Hylics 2 - Remaining Helper Issues

No helper issues identified. The game-specific helpers are already implemented in the frontend.

**Helper File Location:** `frontend/modules/shared/gameLogic/hylics_2/hylics2Logic.js`

The file was successfully loaded during testing as shown in the test output:
```
[WebServer] GET /frontend/modules/shared/gameLogic/hylics_2/hylics2Logic.js HTTP/1.1" 200
```

All helper functions are working correctly as evidenced by the successful test run.
