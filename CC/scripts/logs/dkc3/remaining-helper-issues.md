# Remaining Helper Issues for Donkey Kong Country 3

No helper issues have been identified yet.

Note: The spoiler test for seed 2 passed successfully, which suggests that all required helper functions are either:
1. Not needed for this game (game uses only standard rule types)
2. Already implemented
3. Successfully inlined during rule expansion

Further testing with additional seeds may reveal helper function requirements.
