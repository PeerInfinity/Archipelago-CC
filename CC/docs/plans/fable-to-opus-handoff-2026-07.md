# Fable → Opus handoff — cross-arc queue (2026-07-11)

**Purpose.** Written at the Fable→Opus transition (Fable access ends ~2026-07-13).
During 2026-07-10/11 every active arc was either shipped or carried to a fully
ruled design; this document is the single ordered queue of what comes next,
with dependencies. Detail lives in the per-arc plan docs and memory topic
files — this doc is the map, not the territory.

**How to use.** Each section names its plan doc and memory topic. Plan docs
marked *(NewDocs)* live in the gitignored `NewDocs/` tree — not in git
history, but present in the working tree and available to Opus sessions.
Memory topic files hold the durable pointers. Standing convention: a NewDocs
plan moves to `CC/docs/plans/` when its implementation starts.

**Standing cross-cutting rules (apply to everything below):**
- **Intended-solution-first testing** (user ruling 2026-07-11): witness
  replay / bot completion are the hard gates; "no unintended solution" gets
  bounded budgets at calibration time only. See
  `feedback_intended_solution_first_testing` memory.
- **Every verification suite needs one independent stratum** (real saves,
  in-app tests, separate oracle) — a verifier sharing the generator's
  assumptions verifies nothing. See `feedback_verifier_shared_assumption`.
- **Byte-inert at defaults**: fork features ship default-off behind
  options; parity/determinism goldens must pass with everything at default.
- **Git discipline**: explicit staging only (never `git add -A`); commit
  submodule first, outer pointer bump in its own commit; push submodule
  branches BEFORE any outer push that bumps them; push only when asked.

## 1. Runner substrate — OR-lanes are the only remaining work

Status: coverage RESTORED. The test-strategy rebalance SHIPPED+PUSHED
2026-07-12, CI green (JavaScript Unit Tests 11m36s, whole slow battery under
the ~15–18 min target). runnerDemo suites are back in both vitest configs.

1. **~~Implement the test-strategy rebalance~~ — DONE 2026-07-12** (Opus; 5
   commits on `main`, pushed, CI green). Default suite is generation-free;
   heavy sweeps demoted to a manual `vitest.calib.config.js` tier
   (`npm run test:unit:calib`, not in CI); the **G1 preset bot-replay gate**
   (`presetBot.slow.test.js`, 9/9) replaced the retired matrix rows. G2
   stored-witness tapes were DEFERRED (optional; G1 subsumes most of the
   value; sidecar plumbing non-trivial). The redundant canRun "layered flood
   ⇔ full graph" loop was deleted (frozen corpus already covers it). Details:
   `project_runner_substrate` memory. Plan doc (now historical):
   `NewDocs/plans/procedural-platformer/runner-test-strategy-rebalance.md`.
2. **Then OR-route lanes O1–O5 — the remaining Runner work** — *(NewDocs)*
   `runner-or-lanes-step6-plan.md`. De-risked: the verify/emission stack
   handles OR today (experiment-confirmed); work is confined to
   planStripSpecsV2 + orGate grammar + integration. Verification follows the
   rebalanced doctrine (witness per disjunct = hard gate; lane exclusivity =
   bounded, calibration-time). Memory: `project_runner_substrate`.

## 2. World persistence across reloads (small, self-contained)

Implement P1–P4 of *(NewDocs)* `NewDocs/plans/world-persistence-reload-design.md`
(sessionStorage `apcc_lastWorld` riding the existing
`moduleSpecificConfig.rulesConfig` boot channel — deliberately NOT a new init
catch-up). Acceptance must include: (a) the live reload repro (preset → Run
all → Load → page reload → panel reattaches) — the design session verified by
code-reading only; (b) the **stale-path leg**: a persisted preset path whose
fetch 404s at boot must degrade to first-preset and clear the record (this
failure happens AFTER the sessionStorage read succeeds, so the self-clear
guard doesn't obviously cover it); (c) `restoreLastWorld` (schema default on)
must be read honoring the schema default — do not repeat the `autoLoadMode`
boot-reader pattern fixed in `5fa4b4726`. Memory:
`project_world_persistence_reload`.

## 3. JtA — post-v1 and retirement track

Phase 5 is COMPLETE (5a–5f + 5g raw-value/Fork 1.8 with all riders;
tick-for-tick triple equivalence green). Memory:
`project_jta_zone_randomization`.

1. **Post-v1 phases A→E** — *(NewDocs)*
   `NewDocs/plans/jta/jta-synthetic-post-v1-design.md`, all 7 rulings
   accepted. Phase 0 (5g) is done; start at A. Carry-forward data point:
   5g reduced worst Pass-B saturation by an order of magnitude (1.1e4 vs
   1.09e5) but did NOT eliminate it — the economy-scaling lever retains a
   residual case even on C4-clean linear worlds.
2. **jtaActionQueue → substrate port** —
   `CC/docs/plans/jta-action-queue-port-plan.md`, all 10 rulings settled,
   zero fork changes v1. Feeds item 3.
3. **Phase 6 absorption audit** — parent plan §5 absorption map. Gates the
   old-March-stack retirement (deletion itself is a separate future change
   per standing ruling).
4. **Backlog (in `CC/docs/cleanup-backlog.md`):** the presets-guard 300s
   zone-demo click budget is a coin flip under load — bump to ~450s
   (one-liner); the balance-walk solve-at-completion fix (own step + batch
   re-run — invalidates caches and committed measurement records, NOT a
   drive-by); task-256/z12 filler stranding stays accepted unless a
   multiworld hardens the gate (measured remedy: `threshold_other_metric =
   RESETS`).

## 4. Omsi Loops — the one open design front

Memory: `project_omsi_loops_fork`. Plan docs *(NewDocs)* in
`NewDocs/plans/omsiloops/`.

1. **Scoring-horizon design pass (§11.5) — LANDED 2026-07-11 (session 8,
   fork `automation` @ `4174348`, pushed, CI green).** Shipped:
   `expGainMultiplier` (exp-only at the three engine funnels, byte-inert at
   1), snapshot-start resume (byte-exact; carries the knowledge table;
   runner `--gain-mult`/`--save-state`/`--from-state` + sidecar progress
   logs), travelRelief=3 + headroom=1 scoring terms (mana units, gated
   `pre.townsUnlocked.length > 1`), the **capacity-probe fix** (pump cost =
   Σ lastExec manaUsed, cushion-chunked interleaved harvest — the starved
   probe had been silently crippling expedition tails since M2), the
   Stats-panel Automation view (settings moved from Extras + live internals
   incl. Pools & ledgers), `AUTOMATION.md`, `plannerControlLootFirst`
   (plan/play consistency on the DOM-only searchToggler boxes), and harness
   `--metric loops|ticks|wall|weighted` (default stays loops — user
   ruling). All byte-gates green (v0 acceptance on all three trees,
   cross-checks loop+tick-exact, npm 25/25, UI smoke 23/23).
   **Round 7 key finding: the probe fix — not the scoring terms — was the
   lever.** At 1× (shared L500 donor) full design ≈ terms-zeroed control,
   both with sustained town-1 investment Round 6 never reached; the town-2
   wall STANDS at 1× L1200 (economy: 9k/loop toll vs bank-limited ~39k
   plateau). 10× melts on its own (L213; fixed tree L232 — the terms
   slightly hurt where frontier dominates); 100× has no wall at all (L85)
   and cannot discriminate designs.
   **Session 9 update (2026-07-12, Fable) — metrics resolved + speed
   infrastructure shipped (SUMMARY Rounds 8–11; plan §11.5/§11.6/§11.7 +
   memory all updated):**
   - **Success metric RESOLVED (user ruling): "track both, move on"** —
     loops stays primary, ticks/wall recorded beside it on every run; the
     disagreement hunt was NULL at the optimum (bankPot:8 = argmin under
     BOTH metrics, 484 / 5,099,270 — beats the shipped default
     −3.2%/−6.1%). Weight recalibration is thereby UNGATED.
   - **Wander-first human openings CLOSED as failure** (Round 8):
     exploration CONVERGES (every arm ends town 1 at Explored 100%,
     identical pools — the planner buys glasses L105 and explores 4x
     interleaved); user doctrine: no special-case openings. Talent
     residue devalued (every action gives talent; expMult ladder).
   - **bank:20 is a FIXATION HOLE** (Round 9): DNF at the 1200 cap
     between healthy neighbors (15→531, 30→500) — weight calibration is
     a ROBUSTNESS problem; sweeps must treat DNFs as first-class;
     candidate general mechanism = cap-triggered anti-fixation guard.
   - **Eval pool + screenMode SHIPPED** (fork `automation` @ `e3d4d89`,
     3 commits; Rounds 10–11): setEvalPool hook + confirmCandidate +
     per-phase instrumentation; `--pool N` worker_threads host; profiling
     OVERTURNED the standing assumption — the Koviko predictor screen was
     80–93% of planning wall, engine confirms 5–14%. **`--screen-mode
     engine` = the ITERATION regime** (~5x; full 1x runs ≈ 2.6 min;
     quality 514/5.95M vs reference 500/5.43M); `none` proved the K-CUT
     is the regularizer (reproduces Round 4 screenK:16 exactly).
     Gates/reference stay `predictor` (default, byte-inert — no
     re-baseline). 0 RNG throughout ⇒ every gap is a deterministic fact;
     there is no seed axis until AP randomization exists.

   **SEQUENCING RULING (user, 2026-07-12): ARCHITECTURE CHANGES FIRST,
   calibration LAST.** Weights are calibrated to a scoring vocabulary and
   candidate set; recalibrating before the vocabulary settles is
   throwaway work.
   **Session 10 status (2026-07-12, Fable): items 1–4 DONE (1–2 shipped,
   3–4 designed awaiting user review).** ① Census SHIPPED —
   `CC/scripts/omsi-stats/ACTION-CENSUS.md` + SUMMARY Round 12
   (`b32f9d33b`). ② Rep-gap tracker SHIPPED — fork `automation` @
   `2b79ceb` (`predictorRepGap` default-off; byte-gate PASS
   500/5,432,753/54506b48; npm 33/33). ③ bank:20 DIAGNOSED — SUMMARY
   Round 13 (`b8e627adf`) + plan §11.9 design: root cause = the
   capacity probe is STARVED at all [0] states (prevTimeNeeded 5250 in
   hole AND reference — the a39bc27 interleave is gated
   townsUnlocked>1) + rep-bank-capped h-ladder (h≤3 vs healthy h4–h6);
   proposed Part A (un-gate probe at [0] + optimistic h arm —
   RE-BASELINE items, fold into queue item 6 as its first change) and
   Part B (streak≥32/drought≥256 search-escalation guard; healthy max
   16/135 across all 11 traces — byte-inert by margin). ④ Vocabulary
   design in plan §11.8 (read-state extension → gate metadata → scored
   channels → `plannerVocabulary` option boundary). Unscheduled user
   idea recorded (plan §11.5 addendum): `rngMode: cycle` for the 4
   reward-path RNG sites.
   **RE-SCHEDULED QUEUE (user ruling 2026-07-12, later session 10 —
   §11.10 targeted mode SCHEDULED; supersedes items 5–6 ordering
   below):**
   1. **§11.8 pieces 1–2** — plReadState extension (buffs/soulstones/
      goldInvested/trial+dungeon state/multipart totals; byte-inert
      additive), then gate metadata (guild/negative-rep/upper-bound/
      stock/time gates → setup-prefix measurement + gate-aware
      candidates). Prerequisite for targeted-mode chain completeness.
   2. **§11.10 targeted mode v1 + priority list** — within-loop goal
      regression over the measured needs/provider/threshold graph;
      ordered target list with residual-budget fitting; heuristic mode
      = priority-∞ fallback; stagnation trigger (§11.9 Part B's
      counters, healthy≤16 streak/135 drought vs hole 617) auto-enters
      a targeted round from heuristic mode. §11.9 Part B's blind
      escalation is SUPERSEDED by this; §11.6's ordered-priority idea
      is ABSORBED by this. Multi-loop setup chains = v2, deferred.
   3. Then as before: tail trim / remaining ladder rungs (auto-add,
      simple balancing) / §11.7 Design B — as the user prioritizes.
   4. LAST (unchanged): the ONE deliberate re-baseline + recalibration
      — now bundling §11.9 Part A (un-gate the starved [0] capacity
      probe + always-include optimistic h arm), §11.8 piece 3 scored
      channels, DNF-aware sweeps, bankPot:8 re-test.
   Original queue (for reference):
   1. **Systematic action-code audit (user: HIGH priority)**: read all
      157 actions' reward/effect code and produce a complete census of
      what the automation's vocabulary cannot see. The session-8 audit
      found EXAMPLES (buff grants `addBuffAmt` ×7, non-travel manaCost
      cheapening, soulstones, multiparts opaque, and now the L292
      discovery undervaluation) — it was not exhaustive. The census
      DEFINES the vocabulary the architecture work must express; do it
      before designing the metadata schema.
   2. **Assist-tools track, first deliverable (user plan, §11.6): the
      rep-gap tracker** — report when an action's total queued reps <
      its currently-unlocked reps (the user built exactly this as a
      personal predictor patch years ago). Small, independent, ships
      default-off; the first rung of the §11.6 ladder (auto-add = rung
      2, simple balancing = rung 3).
   3. bank:20 fixation diagnosis → anti-fixation guard design (general
      mechanism, per the no-special-cases doctrine; robustness is an
      architecture property).
   4. Scorer/candidate vocabulary DESIGN from the audit census: ruled
      direction = declarative per-action metadata behind an option (the
      pure-empirical mode survives for AP); high-expMult grind
      CANDIDATES for talent (the scoring term already ships at W.talent
      0.01 — do NOT re-add it); the L292 discovery lesson.
   5. Queue-emission: exact-count tail trim (SUPERSEDES repeatLastAction;
      metric-dependent). Remaining §11.6 ladder rungs + priority
      checkboxes; §11.7 Design B live no-pause pipelining (designed,
      unbuilt; late-plan policy open) — as ruled/prioritized by the user.
   6. ONLY THEN: one deliberate re-baseline + full weight recalibration
      in the town-0 lab against the settled architecture (engine mode +
      pool make it ~30 min; DNF-aware; bankPot:8 = the Round-9 datum to
      re-test, NOT a pre-settled answer). Changing DEFAULT_WEIGHTS =
      re-baseline of the frozen byte-reference, own step.
   **AP ruling stands: v1 location checks = RESOURCE unlocks (pool
   discovery + lootable checking), NOT action unlocks** (discretization
   plan §7). Settle the base algorithm in town-0 mode before more
   multi-town work (unchanged).
2. **Unlock-discretization U0–U5** —
   `omsi-loops-unlock-discretization-plan.md` (~5–6 days, on `substrate`).
   Defines the AP location pool; extractor prototyped (157×2 predicates,
   0.8s); enforcement = suppression-scoped `getNextValidAction` check; keep
   the differential corpus + real-save-fixture stratum as a LIVE gate (it is
   also the non-monotone detector — Buy Glasses is the only one TODAY).
3. **Housekeeping when stable:** merge `automation` → `substrate`, then bump
   the outer submodule pointer (currently held on `substrate` per standing
   ruling). Remaining Phase E slices: action-completion callback,
   setTownGate, instant stepping, cloud-save hard-off audit.
4. **Social:** cirne DM drafted, unsent, non-blocking
   (`cirne-dm-draft.md`); community post waits for "something to show";
   never bundle the license ask + AP announcement + AI disclosure in one
   post.

## 5. Cavernous II — Stage 2 onward

Memory: `project_new_substrates_planning`. Plan *(NewDocs)*
`NewDocs/plans/cavernous/cavernous2-substrate-plan.md`. Stage 0+1 SHIPPED,
pushed, fork CI green; simple-mode boost byte-inert-proven.

Inputs already settled — do not re-derive:
- **v1 AP pool** = *(NewDocs)* `experiments/derived-rules-zone1.md` (+ .json):
  35/35 classified; iron chain = the ONLY hard-dep class (9 bridge
  locations); everything else pure mana budget (M* 5→376).
- **Location trigger RULED = REACH** (single layer: check hook on
  enter/setMined; ghost suppression stays on the grant side). The generator
  keeps `TRIGGER=completion` env mode for re-pricing comparisons; a later
  machine-split into completion-keyed locations is a recorded idea.
- **÷E² combat-intake correction is WRONG** — refuted by twin runs; vanilla
  intake gives exact parity. `effectiveCloneCount()` in settings.ts is the
  single definition of E.
- **Playback requirements:** chain veins must be picked by Dijkstra cost;
  the portal is a PRESENT action — walking onto Θ does nothing, queues must
  include it.
- **Contingency toggles** (kudzu no-regrow, iron-bridge persist) are
  pre-designed, adopt-on-evidence only; the stats harness must measure
  loops-to-milestone toggles-off vs on BEFORE any toggle defaults on (the
  balance pass needs to know which mode it prices).
- **v0 victory** = reach zone 2 — the portal is pit-gated, so it exercises
  the full iron→furnace→anvil→bridge chain.

## 6. Everything else (unchanged queues)

Pre-existing next steps that predate this transition, in their topic files:
top-down stepped pipeline phases 4/5/6 (editors); sphere-growth soft
difficulty (deferred); grid-growth retirement (planned, not started); docs
migration help module; flashPanel unification. Nothing from the 07-10/11
work blocks on them.
