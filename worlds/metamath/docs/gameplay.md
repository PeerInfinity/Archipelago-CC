# Metamath Gameplay Guide

## How It Works

In Metamath, you're not just playing a game—you're constructing a mathematical proof! Each step of the proof is a location that needs to be "proven" by collecting the required statement items.

## Core Concepts

### Statements = Items
Every mathematical statement in your proof becomes an item. For example:
- `Statement 1: df-2` - The definition that 2 = (1 + 1)
- `Statement 5: 2cn` - The axiom that 2 is a complex number
- `Statement 8: addassi` - The associativity of addition

### Proof Steps = Locations
Each statement that needs to be proven is a location. To "check" a location, you need all the statements it depends on. For example:
- `Prove Statement 6` might require Statements 1 and 3
- `Prove Statement 10` might require Statements 6 and 9

### Dependencies = Access Rules
Mathematical logic determines access! You can only prove a statement if you have all its logical prerequisites.

## Example: Playing "2 + 2 = 4"

Let's walk through the famous proof that 2 + 2 = 4:

### The Proof Structure
```
1. df-2: "2 = (1 + 1)" (definition)
2. df-3: "3 = (2 + 1)" (definition)
3. df-4: "4 = (3 + 1)" (definition)
4. ax-1cn: "1 is a complex number" (axiom)
5. 2cn: "2 is a complex number" (axiom)
6. oveq2i: "(2 + 2) = (2 + (1 + 1))" [requires: df-2]
7. oveq1i: "(3 + 1) = ((2 + 1) + 1)" [requires: df-3]
8. addassi: "((2 + 1) + 1) = (2 + (1 + 1))" [requires: ax-1cn, 2cn]
9. 3eqtri: "4 = (2 + (1 + 1))" [requires: df-4, oveq1i, addassi]
10. eqtr4i: "(2 + 2) = 4" ✓ [requires: oveq2i, 3eqtri]
```

### Gameplay Flow

1. **Start**: You begin with 10% of statements (typically Statement 1)
2. **Early Game**: Find basic definitions and axioms (Statements 2-5)
3. **Mid Game**: Build intermediate results (Statements 6-8)
4. **End Game**: Combine everything to reach the final theorem (Statements 9-10)

### In Multiworld

Your proof steps can be scattered across different worlds:
- You might find `df-2` in Link's chest in Zelda
- Another player might send you `ax-1cn` from their Mario level
- You could find `3eqtri` as a check in Pokémon

## Strategy Tips

### 1. Understand Your Proof
Before playing, look up your theorem on [metamath.org](https://us.metamath.org/). Understanding the logical flow helps you prioritize checks.

### 2. Identify Bottlenecks
Some statements depend on many others. Finding these "hub" statements early opens up more locations:
- In 2p2e4: `addassi` and `3eqtri` are key bottlenecks
- In pm5.32: `3bitri` combines multiple branches

### 3. Communicate Dependencies
Tell your multiworld partners what you need:
- "I need Statement 3 (df-4) to unlock 2 locations"
- "Statement 8 (addassi) is blocking my progression"

### 4. Filler Items
Items like "Proof Hint" and "Logic Guide" are filler items that don't affect progression but fill remaining item slots.

## Common Theorems and Their Difficulty

### Beginner (1-5 steps)
- `1p1e2` (1 + 1 = 2): 2 steps, very quick
- `pm2.21`: 2 steps, simple logic

### Intermediate (5-15 steps)
- `2p2e4` (2 + 2 = 4): 10 steps, good balance
- `3p3e6` (3 + 3 = 6): 12 steps, similar to 2p2e4
- `pm5.32`: 9 steps, propositional logic

### Advanced (15+ steps)
- Complex theorems from algebra, analysis, or topology
- Custom proofs from specialized areas

## Tracking Your Progress

Since there's no dedicated client yet, you'll need to track your progress manually or use general Archipelago tracking tools. Keep notes on which statements you've collected and which locations are available based on your current items.

## Mathematical Concepts

Don't worry if you don't understand the math! The game is about logical dependencies, not mathematical knowledge. However, here are some common symbols:

- `|-` means "it is provable that"
- `->` means "implies"
- `<->` means "if and only if"
- `e.` means "is an element of"
- `CC` means "complex numbers"
- `/\` means "and"
- `\/` means "or"
- `-.` means "not"

## Completion

You win when you prove your target theorem! This happens when you:
1. Collect all required statement items
2. Check the final proof location
3. The complete proof validates

## Tips for New Players

1. **Start Simple**: Try `1p1e2` for your first game
2. **Read the Proof**: Check the theorem on metamath.org
3. **Track Dependencies**: Keep notes on what requires what
4. **Ask for Help**: The math community loves explaining proofs!

## Advanced Strategies

### Sphere Analysis
Proof steps naturally form "spheres" based on dependencies:
- Sphere 0: Starting statements and axioms
- Sphere 1: Statements requiring only Sphere 0
- Sphere 2: Statements requiring Sphere 1
- etc.

Understanding spheres helps predict progression.

### Parallel Branches
Many proofs have independent branches that merge later. You can work on multiple branches simultaneously for efficiency.

### Critical Path
Identify the longest chain of dependencies. This is your minimum number of steps to completion, assuming perfect item distribution.

## Have Fun!

Remember: You're literally playing with the fundamental building blocks of mathematics. Every game is a journey through centuries of mathematical discovery!
