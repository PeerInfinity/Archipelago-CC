## Example Gameplay Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Timer
**Player**: NewToMath
**Theorem**: `1p1e2`
**Settings**: Simple, 50% starting

```
Generation: Creates 2 proof steps
Starting with: Statement 1 (df-2)
Need to find: Statement 2 (eqcomi)
Gameplay: Find one item to complete the proof!
```

### Scenario 2: Multiworld Integration
**Player**: MathGeek
**Theorem**: `2p2e4`
**Other Players**: Zelda, Mario, Pokémon

```
Turn 1: Find "Statement 3 (df-4)" in Zelda's dungeon
Turn 2: Zelda finds your "Statement 5 (2cn)" in Death Mountain
Turn 3: Mario sends you "Statement 8 (addassi)"
Turn 4: You can now prove Statement 9 (3eqtri)!
```

### Scenario 3: Race Setup
**All Players**: Same theorem `2p2e4`
**Settings**: Moderate, 10% starting, minimal accessibility

```
Goal: First to prove 2+2=4 wins
Strategy: Rush for key dependencies (addassi, 3eqtri)
Challenge: Items might be in other worlds
```

## Example Commands

### Generating a Game

```bash
# Single player
python Generate.py --weights_file_path "examples/standard.yaml"

# Multiworld with friends
python Generate.py \
  --weights_file_path "math_player.yaml" \
  --weights_file_path "zelda_player.yaml" \
  --weights_file_path "mario_player.yaml"
```

### Tracking Your Progress

Since there's no dedicated client yet, you'll need to manually track:
- Which statements you've collected
- Which locations are available based on dependencies
- What items you still need to find

## Example Proof Walkthrough: 2 + 2 = 4

Here's how the proof unfolds in gameplay:

1. **Start**: You have `Statement 1 (df-2)` which defines 2 = (1+1)

2. **Early finds**:
   - Find `Statement 3 (df-4)` → Defines 4 = (3+1)
   - Find `Statement 4 (ax-1cn)` → Axiom: 1 is complex

3. **Unlock locations**:
   - Can now check `Prove Statement 6` (needs Statement 1)
   - Receive `Statement 6 (oveq2i)`

4. **Mid-game**:
   - Find `Statement 2 (df-3)` and `Statement 5 (2cn)`
   - Can prove `Statement 7` and `Statement 8`

5. **Convergence**:
   - With Statements 3, 7, and 8 → Can prove `Statement 9 (3eqtri)`
   - With Statements 6 and 9 → Can prove `Statement 10 (eqtr4i)`

6. **Victory**: 2 + 2 = 4 is proven!

## Tips from Examples

1. **Start small**: `1p1e2` is perfect for learning
2. **Standard choice**: `2p2e4` is the "Hello World" of Metamath
3. **For groups**: Use different theorems to reduce competition
4. **For racing**: Use the same theorem with minimal accessibility
5. **For learning**: High starting_statements help
