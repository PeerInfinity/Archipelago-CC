"""
Pickle Mixin for Universal Tracker

This mixin adds pickle-based multiworld loading to TrackerCore. It allows the
tracker to load a pre-generated multiworld directly from a gzip-compressed
dill pickle file, which preserves lambdas and functions in access rules.

This is an alternative to the worldgen mixin that:
- Is faster (no world generation needed)
- Preserves exact original lambdas (no AST conversion)
- Requires dill library for lambda serialization

Usage:
    from .pickle_mixin import PickleMixin

    class TrackerCore(PickleMixin, WorldgenMixin, BaseTrackerCore):
