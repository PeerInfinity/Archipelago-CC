"""
Monkey patching module for JSON Tools.

Provides runtime patches for Archipelago core files when file-based
patching is not available or desired.

This is used as a fallback for unsupported AP versions.

Usage:
    from worlds.json_tools_installer.monkey_patches import install_hooks

    # Install all hooks
    results = install_hooks()

    # Check what's installed
    from worlds.json_tools_installer.monkey_patches import get_installed_hooks
    print(get_installed_hooks())

    # Uninstall
    from worlds.json_tools_installer.monkey_patches import uninstall_hooks
    uninstall_hooks()
