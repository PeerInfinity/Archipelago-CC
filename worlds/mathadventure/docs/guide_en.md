# MathProof2p2e4 Guide

## Overview

MathProof2p2e4 is a mathematical adventure where you must collect definitions, axioms, and theorems to prove that 2+2=4.

## Game Structure

The game consists of several regions representing different areas of mathematical logic:

- **Menu**: Starting region
- **Definitions**: Contains basic mathematical definitions (2, 3, 4)
- **Axioms**: Contains fundamental axioms (1 is Complex)
- **BasicProperties**: Contains basic mathematical properties (2 is Complex)
- **ArithmeticOperations**: Contains operation-related theorems
- **ProofCompletion**: Final region where you complete the proof

## Items

The following items (mathematical concepts) can be collected:

### Definitions
- **df-2**: Definition of 2
- **df-3**: Definition of 3  
- **df-4**: Definition of 4

### Axioms
- **ax-1cn**: 1 is Complex

### Theorems
- **2cn**: 2 is Complex
- **oveq2i**: Operation Equality 2 Inference
- **oveq1i**: Operation Equality 1 Inference
- **addassi**: Addition Associativity Inference
- **3eqtri**: 3-Way Equality Transitive Inference
- **eqtr4i**: Equality Transitive 4 Inference

## Victory Condition

To complete the game, you must reach the "Theorem: 2+2=4" location in the ProofCompletion region with all the necessary mathematical concepts to prove the theorem.

## Tips

- Some regions require specific items to access
- The ArithmeticOperations region requires either df-2 or df-3 to enter
- Certain locations within regions have their own item requirements
- Plan your route carefully to collect all necessary proofs efficiently
