/**
 * seedlingDemo/solverBot — the LIVE SOLVER POLICY. R8 slice 2, kickoff
 * `NewDocs/plans/seedling-bot-r8-opus-kickoff.md` §3.1 / §4 slice 2 (⚖ §6.2
 * ruled the name and the placement: a peer of the planner, beside
 * `botDriverV2`).
 *
 * The sense→plan→act loop: given a live run and a GOAL LIST, each decision it
 * (1) SENSES the run's own getters plus the union danger map, (2) PLANS — a
 * waypoint corridor from the A\* stack, planned against the run's OWN
 * full-bag geometry, (3) IDENTIFIES the blocking obstacle when no corridor
 * exists (the planner's own {kind, blocker} names it), (4) SELECTS a strategy
 * — the VERB LIBRARY is the catalog, invoked reactively rather than from a
 * leg spec — and (5) ACTS via `run.advance(held)` (through the shared `drive`
 * primitive and the verbs' own internal loops), recording the tick's keys and
 * a DECISION TRACE row.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS *NOT* (slice 2's scope, stated) ──────────────────────
 *
 *   · NO COMBAT POLICY. The danger map is SENSED at every decision point and
 *     its reason list reaches the trace and every refusal — but the response
 *     to danger this slice is a NAMED REFUSAL, not a dodge. Dodge /
 *     opportunistic attack / walk-past are slice 3's policies, and they ADD
 *     strategy rows to `STRATEGY_EXECUTORS` rather than restructuring this
 *     loop.
 *   · NO SEARCH OVER RUN FUTURES. There is no `run.clone()` (kickoff §2.1's
 *     named gap), and slice 2 needs none: the policy is greedy-with-replan,
 *     and the only search it runs (`mover.findEarliestArrival`, when a
 *     corridor is contested) searches the PHYSICS stratum from a state
 *     triple, not the run. Re-run-from-boot is the accepted v1 fallback and
 *     nothing here reaches for it yet.
 *
 * ── THE FULL BAG (⛔ §8.3.1, the first thing this module had to read) ──
 *
 * The legacy planner forwards 8 of the 14 live-geometry families and is
 * PRESERVED that way (re-routing committed legs is a re-record; no licence
 * exists). The solver plans with all fourteen: `run.liveGeometryOpts()` — the
 * run's OWN `liveSolidOpts`, normalised and branded — handed to
 * `plannerObstacleAt` as `liveBag`, its second entry shape. One policy
 * implementation, two entries; a hand-written fourteen-family roster here
 * would have been trap 86's sixth occurrence.
 *
 * ── WHERE IT REFUSES, AND HOW (never a silent stall) ──────────────────
 *
 * Every dead end is a `SolverRefusal` that NAMES the obstacle (the
 * census/semantic vocabulary via the planner's own blocker record), the goal
 * it was serving, the strategies considered with the reason each was
 * rejected, and — when danger is involved — the danger map's reason list.
 * The trace rows recorded so far ride on the error (`refusal.rows`), so a
 * refused segment is still reviewable.
 *
 * ── RE-PLAN CADENCE (a slice-2 design decision, recorded in §10) ──────
 *
 * The policy re-plans on EVENTS, not on a tick clock: (a) no current plan —
 * goal start, or a verb just edited the world; (b) a waypoint drive failed
 * (a blocked sweep or a stall) — ONE re-plan from the live position, as a
 * TRACE ROW, then a refusal if the retry fails too (a silent re-plan hides a
 * model divergence; a TRACED one is a decision); (c) the sensed contact set
 * is position-scoped, so every plan re-senses it. A per-tick A\* would buy
 * nothing: the world edits at verb cadence, not tick cadence, and the
 * per-tick reactive layer is `drive`'s own transition/volume/hit checks plus
 * the danger probe at every DECISION point.
