# Archipelago JSON Export Tools - Documentation

This is the official documentation for the Archipelago JSON Export Tools and its associated web client. This documentation provides comprehensive guides for both users of the application and developers looking to contribute or understand its architecture.

This project is a fork of the main Archipelago project that focuses on two key areas:

1.  A Python-based system to export a game's logic (location access rules, region connections, item data) into a standardized JSON format.
2.  A modular, feature-rich web client that consumes this JSON to provide advanced tracking, accessibility analysis, and other tools.

For the main project overview, live demo link, and credits, please see the [README.md at the project root](../../README.md).
