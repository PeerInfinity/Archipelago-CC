# Standard Client User Guide

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of the JSON Web Client when used as an advanced tracker and client for standard Archipelago multiworld games. It leverages your game's `rules.json` file to offer powerful insights into location accessibility, helping you understand your world's logic and track your progress effectively.

## Core Concepts

- **Logic-Aware Tracking:** Unlike a simple item tracker, this client understands your game's rules. When you add an item to your inventory, it instantly re-evaluates the entire game world to show you exactly which locations and exits are now accessible.
- **Customizable Layout:** The interface is built on Golden Layout, a system that allows you to drag, drop, resize, and re-order panels to create a workspace that suits your playstyle. Your custom layout is automatically saved in your browser.

## Getting Started

1.  **Generate Your Game:** When generating your seed, ensure you receive both your `.archipelago` file (for your in-game client) and the corresponding `rules.json` file (for this web client).

2.  **Open the Web Client:** Visit the [JSON Web Client](https://peerinfinity.github.io/Archipelago/).

3.  **Load Your Rules:**

    - In the panel on the left, find the **"Presets"** tab.
    - Click the **"Load JSON File"** button at the top.
    - Select your `rules.json` file. The client will now understand your specific game's logic.

4.  **Connect to the Server:**
    - In the center **"Console & Status"** panel, enter your server address and port (e.g., `archipelago.gg:12345`).
    - Click **"Connect"**. You will see connection status updates in the console.

## Interface Overview

The interface is composed of several panels, which you can rearrange. The default layout is described below.

### Left Panel Stack

#### Inventory Panel

This is your primary tool for tracking items.

- **Adding Items:** Click an item's button to add it to your inventory. If connected to a server, this may send a `!getitem` command.
- **Removing Items:** Hold **SHIFT** and click an item to remove it (this only affects your local tracker state).
- **Progressive Items:** The client correctly handles progressive items (like Swords or Gloves), automatically tracking which version you have.
- **Controls:** Use the checkboxes to hide items you don't own or collapse the category view into a single alphabetical list.

### Center Panel Stack

#### Console & Status Panel

This is your main hub for server interaction and automated checks.

- **Connection Controls:** The server address input and Connect/Disconnect button are at the top.
- **Timer & Progress Bar:** The "Begin!" button starts a timer that automatically checks one of your accessible locations at random intervals. The progress bar shows the countdown to the next check. "Quick Check" immediately checks one location.
- **Checks Sent:** This display gives you a summary of your progress (e.g., `Checked: 50/155`).
- **Console:** The text console works just like a standard Archipelago client. You can chat, use `/` commands for the web client (like `/set_delay`), and `!` commands for the server.

### Right Panel Stack

This stack contains several tabbed views for exploring the game world.

#### Locations View

This view displays a grid of every location in your game. Each card shows:

- **Name & Region:** The location's name and the region it's in. The region name is a clickable link.
- **Accessibility Status:** The card's color indicates its status:
  - **Green:** You can reach the location and have the items to access it.
  - **Red:** The location is completely inaccessible.
  - **Gray:** You have already checked this location.
  - **Blue:** You have clicked this location to check it, but the tracker is waiting for the state to update (this is usually very brief).
  - **Yellow/Orange:** You can reach the region, but lack the items to access the location (or vice-versa).
- **Access Rule:** A visual tree shows the exact logic required, with conditions you meet highlighted in green and unmet ones in red.

#### Exits View

This view is similar to the Locations view but shows the connections (exits) between regions. It's useful for understanding how to navigate the world.

#### Regions View

This view organizes the game world by its regions.

- Each region is a collapsible block showing its locations and exits.
- **Analyze Paths:** This powerful button performs a search from your starting region to the target region. It displays all possible paths and analyzes every rule along the way, compiling a list of exactly what you need to make the path fully traversable.

## Key Features Explained

- **Automatic Event Collection:** When a location that contains an Event Item (like Pendants or Crystals in ALTTP) becomes accessible based on your inventory, the client automatically adds that Event Item to your state. This can immediately unlock access to new areas.
- **Live Accessibility Analysis:** The logic trees for locations and exits are not static. They update in real-time as you add items to your inventory, showing you exactly which conditions are passing or failing. This is the core strength of the client for understanding complex logic.
- **Path Discovery:** The "Analyze Paths" feature is your best tool for figuring out what to do next. If you want to get into the "Swamp Palace" region, analyzing it will tell you every item you are missing to do so, across all possible paths.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Throughout the UI, region names are underlined and clickable. Clicking one will switch you to the **Regions** view and scroll directly to that region, allowing you to quickly explore connections.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need both the `.archipelago` file and `rules.json`?**
A: Yes. Your in-game client uses the `.archipelago` file. This web client uses the `rules.json` file for its logic-aware tracking. You need both for the full experience.

**Q: Can I use this without connecting to a server?**
A: Yes! You can load your `rules.json` file and use the client as a powerful offline tracker. You can manually add items to your inventory and see how accessibility changes.

**Q: How does "Analyze Paths" work?**
A: It performs a search algorithm to find all sequences of connected regions from your starting point to the target. It then examines the access rules for every exit along those paths to determine which items or conditions you are missing to make the entire path accessible.

**Q: What do the different colors on location cards mean?**
A:

- **Green:** Fully accessible. You can get to the location's region, and you have the items to clear the location itself.
- **Red:** Fully inaccessible. You can't get to the region, and/or you don't have items for a key part of the path.
- **Gray:** Location has been checked.
- **Blue:** Location check is "pending" and waiting for state update.
- **Yellow/Orange:** Partially blocked. You can get to the region, but you're missing the specific item(s) to access the location (e.g., you are at the dungeon entrance but don't have the key).
