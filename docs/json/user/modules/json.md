# JSON Panel

The JSON panel lets you save, load, and manage all of your app configuration and game state in one place. Use it to back up your progress, transfer a session to another device, or switch between different game setups.

## What You Can Save

Use the checkboxes to choose which items to include in save/load operations. **Check All** and **Uncheck All** are available for convenience.

| Item | What it contains |
|------|-----------------|
| **Rules Config** | The game's logic and location data (rules.json). Saving this lets you fully restore a game on another device or after clearing your browser. |
| **Module Config** | Which panels and modules are loaded (modules.json). |
| **Layout Config** | The arrangement of panels on screen. *Layout changes take effect after reloading the page.* |
| **User Settings** | Your application preferences (settings.json). |
| **Snapshot (Full State)** | Your complete game state: inventory, checked locations, and reachability data. This is the main thing to save when you want to continue a session later. Checked by default. |
| **Game State (Inv/Checks)** | A minimal version of the above containing only inventory and checked locations. Unchecked by default since Snapshot already covers everything it contains. |

Other modules may add their own entries to this list (for example, the Tests module adds its configuration).

## Saving and Loading

### Save/Load as a File

- **Save Combined to File** — Downloads the selected data as a `.json` file to your computer. Good for backups or sharing a session with someone else.
- **Load Combined from File** — Opens a `.json` file you previously saved and applies it. Game state, rules, and settings are applied immediately; layout changes require a page reload.

### Export/Import via the Editor

- **Export to Text** — Sends the selected data to the [Editor](../editor.md) panel as JSON text, where you can inspect or edit it before applying.
- **Import from Text** — Reads JSON from the Editor panel and applies it. Paste your JSON into the Editor first, then click this button.

### Save to Browser (LocalStorage)

- **Save to LocalStorage** — Saves the selected data under a mode name in your browser. This persists across sessions and is automatically reloaded the next time you open the app.

## Managing Modes

A "mode" is a named configuration saved in your browser. You can have multiple modes for different games or setups.

- **Known Modes in LocalStorage** — Lists all modes you have saved in your browser. Click **Load** to activate a mode on the next page reload, or **Delete** to remove it permanently.
- **Known Modes in modes.json** — Lists predefined modes that came with the app. Click **Load** to switch to one (reloads the page).

The **Mode Name** field at the top of the panel sets the name used when saving to LocalStorage or in exported files.

## Other Controls

- **Export Live Layout** — Exports detailed layout data to the Editor panel. Useful for debugging panel arrangement issues.
- **Reset Default Mode** — Clears the saved default mode from your browser and reloads the app to its base state. Use this if the app becomes stuck or won't load correctly.
