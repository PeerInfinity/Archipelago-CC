## Implementation Progress

### Current Status - Helper-Based Implementation

Initial implementation completed:

1. Created game-agnostic helper infrastructure
2. Implemented ALTTP helper classes
3. Modified rule engine to support helpers
4. Updated Python rule parser to preserve helpers

### Current Issues

1. Basic test failures on simple locations
2. Need to verify rule export format
3. Need to debug helper evaluation flow

### Next Steps

1. Check test_output_rules.json format for Link's House
2. Add debug logging for rule evaluation
3. Fix any issues with rule export
4. Test and fix helper evaluation
5. Complete remaining helper implementations

We're working on fixing rule parsing to better handle:

- Boolean expressions (and/or operations)
- Helper function references
- State methods like state.has() and state.\_lttp_has_key()
- Multi-line expressions and indentation

We've identified that the rule analyzer uses Python's AST visitor pattern, which means:

- Special visit\_\* methods get automatically called for matching node types
- We need to handle Return nodes to catch the boolean operations
- We need to properly handle both parts of compound expressions

The next steps for rule processing are:

- Implement visit_Return to handle boolean operations
- Test compound rule expressions
- Ensure helper functions are properly identified and preserved
- Add more debug logging to trace rule analysis

Here's a summary of the file changes:

New Files Created:

```
frontend/assets/helpers/index.js           - Base helper infrastructure
frontend/assets/games/alttp/helpers.js     - ALTTP helper functions
frontend/assets/games/alttp/inventory.js   - ALTTP inventory management
frontend/assets/games/alttp/state.js       - ALTTP state tracking
```

Modified Files:

```
frontend/assets/ruleEngine.js          - Updated to support helpers
frontend/assets/locationTester.js       - Updated to use new helper system
worlds/generic/RuleParser/analyzer.py  - Modified to preserve helpers
worlds/generic/RuleParser/exporter.py  - Modified to export helper references
worlds/generic/RuleParser/games/alttp.py - Changed to validate vs expand helpers
```

Files No Longer Used:

```
worlds/generic/RuleParser/games/base.py   - Previous helper expansion code not needed
worlds/generic/RuleParser/games/generic.py - Only used for old helper expansion
```

Note that while base.py and generic.py are technically not needed for the new helper-based approach, they might be worth keeping around temporarily until we're confident the new system is working correctly.

### Current Status - Testing Infrastructure

Completed:

1. Automated testing pipeline working
2. Debug logging system implemented
3. Test result collection and analysis working
4. Progressive item tracking implemented

Current Issues:

1. All test cases failing - likely due to:
   - Progressive item handling
   - Rule evaluation
   - Access checks
2. Need to analyze test results and debug logs

Next Steps:

1. Analyze test failure patterns using debug logs
2. Fix progressive item handling in frontend
3. Verify rule evaluation matches Python behavior
4. Add regression tests for each fix

### Recent Progress

1. Fixed test automation:

   - Added proper error handling
   - Implemented comprehensive debug logging
   - Added test result collection
   - Made file downloads optional
   - Added proper initialization of logging chain

2. Enhanced debug capabilities:

   - Added structured logging throughout codebase
   - Improved error reporting
   - Added test result analysis
   - Added rule evaluation tracing

3. Improved test infrastructure:
   - Automated test runner working
   - Debug data collection working
   - Module loading verification
   - Better error boundaries

### Current Status - Rule Export Improvements

1. Implemented proper argument handling
2. Fixed helper function export
3. Test pass rate improved to 85%

### Recent Changes

- Added state/player context parameter filtering
- Improved helper function argument processing
- Fixed state.has() conversion to item_check
- Successfully parsing all basic access rules

### Next Focus Areas

1. Progressive item handling
2. Path rule evaluation
3. Agahnim state tracking

### Current Status - Region Traversal & Events

1. Implemented working BFS with event tracking
2. Fixed infinite looping/recursion issues
3. Added proper region traversal
4. Test run time improved significantly

### Current Issues

1. Location access rules being exported as constant:true
2. Complex requirements not being properly parsed:
   - Multi-item requirements
   - Alternative access paths
   - Progressive item checks
   - Region-dependent rules

### Next Steps

1. Fix rule parsing/export to properly handle complex requirements
2. Improve AST visitor pattern for rule extraction
3. Ensure proper rule export for all test cases
4. Verify BFS logic with complete rule set
