# Implementation Progress - March 1, 2025

## Current Status Summary

The Archipelago JSON Rules system has made significant progress, with the following key features now working:

1. **Complete region-based export format (v3)**
2. **Native JavaScript helper function implementation**
3. **BFS path finding with event tracking**
4. **Interactive UI with multiple view modes**
5. **Test system with automated validation**

All TestLightWorld tests are now passing, demonstrating the core system's functionality.

## Recent Implementation Achievements

### Helper-Based Architecture

The system now preserves helper functions rather than expanding them:

- Helper functions are exported as-is in the JSON
- JavaScript implementations match Python functionality
- Native state tracking system with flags and events
- Centralized state manager for consistent access

### Region Traversal & Events

- Working BFS with proper event tracking
- Added proper region traversal
- Automatic collection of event items
- Significant performance improvements

### User Interface

- Added region path discovery with interactive navigation
- Implemented exit rule visualization for blocked paths
- Added consolidated list view of failing rule conditions
- Created test case UI for interactive test execution
- Enhanced inventory management with progressive items

### State Management

- Centralized state manager as a singleton
- Synchronous operations for consistent state
- Batch update system for efficient state changes
- Support for game mode and settings
- Helper function integration with state

## Architectural Changes

### 1. Helper-Based Implementation

Initial implementation has been completed:

- Created game-agnostic helper infrastructure
- Implemented ALTTP helper classes
- Modified rule engine to support helpers
- Updated Python rule parser to preserve helpers

This approach preserves the original helper functions instead of expanding them, allowing for better maintainability and more accurate representation of the original logic.

### 2. Region-Based Data Structure

The system now uses a comprehensive region-based format (v3) that includes:

- Complete region graph with entrances and exits
- Dungeon and shop data
- Game mode and settings
- Start region information
- Enhanced item and progression data

### 3. Centralized State Management

All state is now managed through a singleton `stateManager`:

- Inventory tracking with progressive items
- Region accessibility calculation
- Event item collection
- Location access evaluation
- Synchronous operations for consistency

### 4. Interactive Path Discovery

The UI now supports:

- Finding paths from starting regions to any target region
- Visualizing inaccessible transitions
- Analyzing exit rules that block progression
- Compiling lists of items needed to access regions

## Testing Progress

Tests for the Light World are now passing at 100%, validating the core functionality of the system. The test infrastructure provides:

- Automated test execution via Playwright
- Comprehensive debug logging
- Test result analysis
- Interactive test case execution

Next testing steps include:

- Running more test scripts beyond TestLightWorld
- Simulating a complete game playthrough
- Adding regression tests for fixed issues
