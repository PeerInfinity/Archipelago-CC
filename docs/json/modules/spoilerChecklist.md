## Styling

```css
/* Section backgrounds */
.sphere-section-completed { background: #1e1e1e; }
.sphere-section-current { background: #2d3d2d; }
.sphere-section-future { background: #3d2d2d; }

/* Cross-player styling */
.cross-player-row { opacity: 0.6; }
.cross-player-region { color: purple; }
```

## Usage

The spoiler checklist is most useful when:
1. A sphere log is loaded for the current game
2. You want to track progress through the logical progression
3. Playing multiworld and need to see items for other players

The checklist automatically updates when:
- Game state changes (locations checked)
- New rules/sphere log is loaded
- Settings change (display options)
