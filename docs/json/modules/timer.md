### Module: `Timer`

- **ID:** `timer`
- **Purpose:** Manages the logic and UI for the automated location checking timer. This module encapsulates the "Begin!" / "Stop" functionality, the progress bar, and the "Quick Check" feature. It is designed to be hosted within another panel.

---

#### Key Files

- `frontend/modules/timer/index.js`: The module's entry point, which handles registration and creates the logic/UI instances.
- `frontend/modules/timer/timerLogic.js`: Contains the core logic for the timer, including starting, stopping, handling intervals, and determining the next location to check.
- `frontend/modules/timer/timerUI.js`: Renders the UI components (progress bar and buttons) and connects them to the `TimerLogic`.

#### Responsibilities

- **Timer Management:** The `TimerLogic` class is responsible for the core timer loop. When started, it calculates a random delay (within a configurable range) and then waits for that duration.
- **Progress Updates:** While the timer is running, it periodically publishes `timer:progressUpdate` events so the UI can display a smoothly advancing progress bar.
- **Location Checking:** When the timer completes, `TimerLogic` determines the next accessible, unchecked location by querying the `StateManager`. It then dispatches a `user:locationCheck` event to the `eventDispatcher` to initiate the check.
- **UI Rendering (`TimerUI`):**
  - Creates the DOM for the progress bar, the `Checks Sent` counter, the "Begin!"/"Stop" button, and the "Quick Check" button.
  - This UI component is "headless"—it does not create its own panel but is designed to be attached to a placeholder element provided by a host panel (like `clientPanel` or `timerPanel`).
- **Control Logic:** Handles user interaction with the "Begin!", "Stop", and "Quick Check" buttons, calling the appropriate methods on the `TimerLogic` instance.

#### Events Published

- `timer:started`: When the main timer begins a new countdown.
- `timer:stopped`: When the timer is manually stopped or finishes.
- `timer:progressUpdate`: Fired periodically while the timer is running to update the progress bar UI.
- **Dispatches to `eventDispatcher`**: `user:locationCheck` when the timer fires or when "Quick Check" is clicked.

#### Events Subscribed To

- `stateManager:rulesLoaded` & `connection:open`: Listens for these to know when to enable the control buttons.
- `stateManager:snapshotUpdated`: Listens for state changes to update the "Checks Sent" counter.
- `loop:modeChanged`: Listens for this to automatically pause itself if the user enters Archipelago Loops mode.

#### Public Functions (`centralRegistry`)

- **`attachTimerToHost(placeholderElement)`:** A function that allows a host panel to provide a DOM element where the `TimerUI` should render itself.
- **`detachTimerFromHost()`:** Removes the `TimerUI` from its current host.
- **`setCheckDelay(min, max)`:** Allows the `/set_delay` console command to configure the timer's delay range.

#### Dependencies & Interactions

- **Host Panels (`clientPanel`, `timerPanel`):** The `Timer` module's UI is not visible unless a host panel is active and calls `attachTimerToHost`. This is managed by the "Dynamic Re-homing" event system.
- **StateManager**: The `TimerLogic` depends on the `StateManager` to determine which locations are currently accessible and unchecked, so it knows what to check next.
- **EventDispatcher**: It is a primary initiator of the `user:locationCheck` event, which is the core action for checking a location in the game.
