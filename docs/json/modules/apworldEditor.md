# APWorld Editor Module

**Module ID:** `apworldEditor` · **Panel:** `apworldEditorPanel`

**Purpose:** the **hub** over a `rules.json` document. It edits regions, exits,
locations, access rules and items directly; it displays *every* top-level key the
document carries; and it is the door to every other editor that owns part of that
document.

- User guide: _not yet written_ — see [TODO](../user/modules/TODO.md)

## Key files

| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `apworldEditorUI.js` | the panel — chrome, tabs, and every handler |
| `rulesDocOps.js` | the document's **atomic ops**, pure and copy-on-write |
| `rulesEditAdapter.js` | those ops as an [`editCore`](./editorCore.md) adapter — `{name, apply, equal}` |
| `rulesUtils.js` | `validateRules`, `cloneFullRulesDoc`, the three rename cascades |
| `ruleTreeEditor.js` | the access-rule tree widget |
| `documentKeys.js` | the top-level **key registry**, derived from `rules.schema.json` |
| `documentLinks.js` | the **Links** tab's rows |

## The document is a session, and the only way in is an op

`rulesDoc` is a **getter** over `session.record()` with no setter: an assignment
throws. Every mutation goes through `_applyOp`, which stamps the selected player
slot and hands the op to the `editCore` session, so the panel has undo (⌘/Ctrl+Z,
refused inside a text field) and a delete cascade is ONE group and therefore ONE
undo.

Three intake paths open a **new** session rather than recording an op, because
each installs a document that arrived from outside and no edit list can express
that: `stateManager:rawJsonDataLoaded`, the focus-safe `apworldEditor:loadRules`
hand-off, and the Reload button. **Undo does not cross a session boundary.**
`Clear`, by contrast, *is* an op — it is a function of the document being edited,
so it is undoable.

`Apply` publishes `files:jsonLoaded` with a full-document clone and **does not**
reset the session, so an undo after an Apply still works.

## Tabs

| Tab | What it edits |
|-----|---------------|
| **Regions** | regions, exits, locations, access rules |
| **Items** | items, classifications, pool counts, starting counts |
| **Meta** | the fields in `rulesDocOps.META_FIELDS`, plus the start region and the victory condition |
| **Document** | **every** top-level key — see below |
| **Links** | every other editor that owns part of a `rules.json` |

## The player selector

A `rules.json` is keyed by **player slot** at eighteen of its thirty-four
top-level keys, and 15 committed presets carry four players. The toolbar's
selector is what every tab reads and what every op is stamped with. Its default
is derived, in this order (`documentKeys.defaultPlayerOf`):

1. the document's own top-level **`playerId`** — the only key that says which slot
   the document is *about*; it is a **string**, and it appears only in
   player-specific exports (`*_P<n>_rules.json`);
2. the first key of `player_names`;
3. the first slot the document actually carries.

⚠ A `playerId` naming a slot the document does not hold is ignored — otherwise
every tab would draw an empty world with nothing saying why.

⛔ Nothing about the selector is gated on `preset_sidecars`: that block is `{}` in
158 of the 192 presets carrying it, and every populated one keys under slot `"1"`
— the four-player multiworld documents included.

## The Document tab is DERIVED from the schema

`documentKeys.buildDocumentKeys(schema)` iterates
[`frontend/schema/rules.schema.json`](../../../frontend/schema/README.md)'s
`properties` and nothing else. Each entry carries the key, a label, the schema's
own `description` (which names the key's **producer**), its type, whether it is
per-player (read off `patternProperties: {"^[0-9]+$"}`, never listed), whether it
is required, which tab already owns it, and an `editor` slot.

⛔ **There is no second hand-maintained key list.** `documentKeys.test.js` asserts
the registry's key set and the schema's are EQUAL in both directions: a schema key
missing from the registry is a key the tab would not draw, and a registry key
absent from the schema is a row about a key nothing produces.

A key the document carries that the schema does **not** declare gets a raw-JSON
row, marked. The schema's top level is strict (`additionalProperties: false`), so
no committed preset can carry one — but a user-loaded file can carry anything, and
an "every element" tab must not silently drop what is visibly in the file.

Keys another tab already edits show a pointer to that tab instead of a second
editor. Everything else is editable, and the whole edit vocabulary is one op:

```js
{ op: 'set-key', key, value, scope: 'document' | 'player', player }
```

⛔ The **scope is recorded, never inferred from `player`**: every op in this module
carries `player` and the panel stamps it on all of them, so "a player is named ⇒
nest under the slot" would put document-level keys under a slot the moment this
tab grew its selector. `value === undefined` deletes the key.

Before a `set-key` reaches the session the panel applies it to a **preview**
document (`applyRulesDocOp` is pure), validates the preview with
`rulesJsonSchemaErrors`, and **differences** the errors against the ones the
document already had. So an edit is refused by name for what *it* breaks, and
never for somebody else's pre-existing violation.

### The `editor` slot

`documentKeys.DOCUMENT_KEY_EDITORS` is a `key → {open}` table that later rungs
fill — `region_atlas` → the marking tool, `procgen_metadata` → the pipeline,
`loop_costs` → the cost debugger. It is **empty** today, and a test row asserts so,
so the day it is filled is visible rather than buried in a diff.

## The Links tab

Substrate rows are **derived** from the substrate registry's own `roomEditor`
declarations (see [`regionEditors`](../developer/procgen/architecture.md)); the
document-level rows — the region marking tool, the procgen pipeline, the loops
cost debugger, the two raw JSON editors and the region graph — are a table
written once, because a panel declares nothing about which key it edits.

Rows open their editor **empty** when the document has no data for it; the tab
draws even with no document loaded at all. Rows whose editor reads **applied**
state (the cost debugger, both raw editors) say so, because they will not see the
working copy until you press Apply.

⚖ The region graph link is **one-way** by user ruling: this tab opens the graph,
and the graph has no button back here. Do not "fix" that asymmetry.

## Events

| Direction | Event | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| subscribes | `stateManager:rawJsonDataLoaded` | opens a session; its own Apply echo is ignored (`pendingApply` + `sourceName: 'apworldEditorApply'`) |
| subscribes | `apworldEditor:loadRules` | the focus-safe hand-off the pipeline and the marking tool use |
| publishes | `files:jsonLoaded` | Apply — a full-document clone |
| publishes | `ui:activatePanel` | the Links tab's rows |

## Tests

| Suite | Where |
