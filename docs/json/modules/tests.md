### Module: `Tests`

- **ID:** `tests`
- **Purpose:** Provides a comprehensive in-app framework for automated feature and integration testing. This system is distinct from the `TestCases` module (which validates game logic against Python) and is used to verify the behavior of the JavaScript application itself, including UI interactions, state management, and module communication. It is the core of the project's Playwright-based end-to-end testing.

#### Key Files

- `frontend/modules/tests/index.js`: The module's entry point.
- `frontend/modules/tests/testLogic.js`: The orchestrator that manages test discovery, execution, and state.
- `frontend/modules/tests/testController.js`: The API provided to individual test functions, allowing them to interact with the application.
- `frontend/modules/tests/testDiscovery.js`: Script that dynamically imports all test case files.
- `frontend/modules/tests/testRegistry.js`: Manages the self-registration of discovered tests.
- `frontend/modules/tests/testCases/`: The directory containing all the individual test case files (e.g., `coreTests.js`, `stateManagementTests.js`).
- `frontend/playwright_tests_config.json`: The configuration file loaded when the app is in "test" mode, defining which tests to run automatically.

#### Responsibilities

- **Test Discovery:** Automatically discovers and imports all test functions from the `frontend/modules/tests/testCases/` directory.
- **Test Orchestration:** Manages the execution of tests, either individually when run from the UI or as a full suite when triggered automatically.
- **Test Controller API:** Provides a powerful `TestController` object to each test function. This controller acts as a bridge, allowing the test to:
  - Log messages and report pass/fail conditions.
  - Interact with the `StateManager` (e.g., `loadRules`, `addItemToInventory`).
  - Simulate user actions (e.g., `SIMULATE_CLICK` on a DOM element).
  - Dispatch events on the `eventBus`.
  - Wait for specific application events to occur (`waitForEvent`), which is crucial for handling asynchronous operations.
- **Playwright Integration:** When the application is run in test mode (`?mode=test`), it automatically executes all enabled tests. Upon completion, it writes a detailed JSON summary of the results to `localStorage` and sets a completion flag. This allows the external Playwright test runner to get the results and validate the application's overall health.
- **UI Panel:** Provides a UI for developers to view all discovered tests, enable or disable them, run them individually or in batches, and see detailed results, conditions, and logs for each test run.

#### Events Published

- `test:listUpdated`, `test:statusChanged`, `test:completed`, `test:allRunsCompleted`, etc.: Publishes a variety of events to its own UI to keep the display live and updated during test execution.

#### Events Subscribed To

This module is primarily a driver of action and does not subscribe to many external events for its core logic, with the notable exception of `app:readyForUiDataLoad` to trigger its initialization and test discovery process.

#### Public Functions (`centralRegistry`)

This module does not register public functions for other modules to call.

#### Dependencies & Interactions

- **Playwright (`tests/e2e/app.spec.js`):** The Playwright test script is the external consumer of this module's automated run. It launches the app in test mode and waits for the `localStorage` flags that this module sets upon completion.
- **StateManager**: The `TestController` interacts heavily with the `StateManager` to set up specific game states required for tests and to verify outcomes.
- **All Modules**: As an integration testing framework, tests written for this module can be designed to interact with any part of the application by simulating user events or calling public functions, making it a powerful tool for end-to-end validation.
