Here is the procedure for testing whether the Archipelago javascript frontend successfully parses the rules from the json file:

The rules are initialized in files in the Python backend.  They consist mainly of lambda functions.
worlds/alttp/Rules.py

The functions in Rules.py refer to some helper functions:
worlds/alttp/StateHelpers.py

There are several files that run pytest to verify these rules.
worlds/alttp/test/vanilla/TestLightWorld.py

The base classes for the test classes:
worlds/alttp/test/vanilla/TestVanilla.py
worlds/alttp/test/__init__.py

The tests use functions like run_location_tests, which is in:
test/bases.py

This calls export_game_rules, which is in:
worlds/generic/RuleParser/__init__.py

That file uses these other files:
worlds/generic/RuleParser/exporter.py
worlds/generic/RuleParser/analyzer.py
worlds/generic/RuleParser/games/__init__.py
worlds/generic/RuleParser/games/alttp.py
worlds/generic/RuleParser/games/base.py
worlds/generic/RuleParser/games/generic.py

This file exports two json files for the frontend to use, one with the data for the rules:
frontend/test_output_rules.json

And one with the test cases to run:
frontend/test_cases.json

Currently, the test runner needs to be opened manually in a browser.  That process might be automated later.

This means that pytest should be configured to run just one test at a time.

Here is a configuration for .vscode/launch.json for launching just one of the tests:

        {
            "name": "Python: TestLightWorld",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "pytest",
            "args": [
                "worlds/alttp/test/vanilla/TestLightWorld.py::TestLightWorld",
                "-v",
                "--capture=tee-sys",
                "-o", "log_cli=true",
                ">", "pytest_output.txt"
            ],
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        },

The main file in charge of running the tests is:
frontend/locationTests.js

That file uses these other files:
frontend/locationManager.js
frontend/ruleEngine.js
frontend/assets/inventory.js
frontend/assets/testLogger.js
frontend/assets/testResultsDisplay.js

The results are saved to test_results.json.
frontend/test_results.json

The rest of the files for the frontend interface are:
frontend/assets/gameUI.js
frontend/styles/index.css
frontend/frontend.html
