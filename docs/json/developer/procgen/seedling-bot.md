# The Seedling Real-Game Bot (v1 + v2)

How we drive the **real recompiled Seedling** with a scripted input tape and
check a JavaScript model of its physics against what the game actually did.

This is the region-atlas Phase 8 "real-game surface". The maze-surface bot
([maze.md](./maze.md)) proves generated worlds beatable on the *projected*
map; this proves things about the **original game**, which is the only
oracle that can say "beatable in the actual game". Plan:
`CC/docs/plans/region-atlas-plan.md` §Phase 8. Briefs and the full recon
trail: `CC/docs/plans/seedling-bot-v1-opus-kickoff.md` and
`seedling-bot-v2-opus-kickoff.md` (whose §7–§13 are the as-built record —
its §1–§6 are the original brief and are wrong in several places those
sections correct).

**Scope as of v2:** collision armed against the real level geometry, room
transitions modelled, and a pathing driver that plans around obstacles and
chains legs across levels. The ladder above is v3 item-gated terrain → v4
puzzles → v5 enemies. Each rung lands in JavaScript first and then in the
Seedling source; the JS side is the iteration surface and is *never* a
load-bearing stratum for a beatability claim. **What actually gates v3+ is
the entity class table, not anything v2 built** — see "What's next" below.

As of 2026-07-30 all **eleven** fixtures match **exactly** — 1084 ticks,
1095 observations and 4 transition records, bit for bit, float noise
included.

## The shape: two implementations, one tape, compared

```

         ▼                              ▼
   observation stream  ==EXACT==  observation stream   ← the differential
```

Both sides consume the *same* tape and emit the *same* observation-stream
shape, so the comparison is about physics rather than bookkeeping. The
game's streams are recorded and **committed** as fixtures, because the wasm
artifact is machine-local forever (there is no CI build in either repo) —
that way vitest checks JS-against-the-real-game on every CI run, and the
local verify script only has to answer "are the recordings still current?".

The module is engine-only — no panel, no substrate registration, therefore
no `__BUNDLED_MODULES__` entry. `runnerDemo` is the structural precedent.
Geometry comes from the committed Phase-2 extract
(`flashPanel/atlases/seedling-map.json`) plus the verbatim AS3 tables in
`flashPanel/seedlingSemantics.js`. **Reuse stops at those tables**: the
analyzer's `CELL_KINDS` / `buildSeedlingRegionGrid` layer is the
region-verifier's altitude and coupling physics to it would import its
assumptions (4-connectivity, tile-granular cliffsides, pits-as-sinks). A
bonus of consuming the extract: the oracle differential now live-tests the
same tables the Phase-5a analyzer trusts.

## The tape

Tick-indexed **hold spans**, `from` inclusive / `to` exclusive:

```json
{ "tape_version": 1, "game": "seedling",
  "boot": { "level": 0, "x": 80, "y": 128 }, "noclip": false,
  "tick_count": 40,
  "inputs": [ { "key": "right", "from": 0, "to": 30 } ] }
```

Spans rather than per-tick key states because Seedling reads input three
ways and the tape must express all of them: movement is `Input.check`
(held), item use is `Input.pressed` (down edge), and **dialogue/NPC/seal is
`Input.released`** — a full down-then-up. A length-1 span yields a press
edge on tick `from` and a release edge on tick `to`, so it covers all three.

Key names map to raw AS3 keycodes through one canonical table asserted by
both consumers (`Player.as:59`). `M`, `R`, `Esc` and `W` are not in the
vocabulary at all and are rejected by name: `Game.update` reads the first
three *before* entities and some branches call `Input.clear()` or rebuild
the world, and `W` opens an external URL.

Validation is loud everywhere — `noclip` has no default, unknown keys
throw, and overlapping spans on one key are rejected (FlashPunk's
`_key[code]` guard makes a second KEY_DOWN a no-op and the first KEY_UP
clears the hold, so overlapping holds do not compose the way an author
would assume).

**⚠ `boot` is a CLAIM about the build, not an instruction to it.** The
spawn is baked into the SWF at `Main.as:51` (`new Game(0, 80, 128)`);
`Bot.as` parses `boot.level` into a field it never reads and ignores
`boot.x`/`boot.y` entirely. A tape declaring anything else was silently
honoured by the JS side and silently ignored by the game, and the
differential then blamed physics for a bookkeeping disagreement — exactly
the asymmetric interpretation the format exists to prevent. `parseTape` now
checks `boot` against `tapeFormat.BUILD_SPAWN`. When the build ever gains a
parameterised boot (an AS3 edit, therefore something to batch), that
constant is the one place that changes.

## How the game is driven

`Bot.as` is a **generic, data-driven tape interpreter**, deliberately dumb.
One AS3 edit costs the entire pipeline (mxmlc → bridge injection →
SWFRecomp's ~165 MB C regeneration → an effectively cold emcc pass →
deploy), so behaviour lives in tapes and in JS, and the interpreter is
compiled in once per ladder rung.

**All of v2 landed with ZERO AS3 edits.** The v1 interpreter already read
`noclip` from the tape header and already re-resolved `Main.level` per
frame, so real collision runs and cross-level tapes were recordable on day
one — which inverted v1's slice order: v2 recorded oracles *first* and
transcribed toward them.

Input synthesis needs no patch. FlashPunk keeps its key state in
`private static` vectors with no setter, but `Input.enable()` registers its
listeners on `FP.stage`, so dispatching a `KeyboardEvent` there drives input
on exactly the hardware path. That holds in the *recompiled* runtime too,
not just Flash Player: its own key delivery ends at the same
`avm2_dispatch_event`.

The hook is the top of `Main.update()`, **above `super.update()`** — after
the previous frame's `Input.update()` cleared the edge queues and before
`World.update()` reaches `Player.input()`, so an injected event is live for
exactly one frame and self-clears.

Control surface, registered by the bot itself as ExternalInterface
callbacks and auto-wrapped by the page shim as `__swfBridge.game.*`:
`botLoadTape`, `botStart`, `botStatus`, `botDrain`, `botReset`. This needs
**no** change to `BridgeGeneric`, to `games/seedling.json`, or to the
one-configure-per-instance fence.

## The bookkeeping contracts

Every one of these is a place where a tidy-looking implementation makes
every differential red for a reason that has nothing to do with physics.

**RECORD-THEN-ACT.** The only hook is *before* the movement, so the bot
records the state it can see — the result of the previous tick — and then
dispatches this tick's edges. Observation `t` is the state after exactly
`t` completed movement ticks: index 0 is the boot position under no input,
and an N-tick tape yields **N+1** observations. `tapeRunner.js` mirrors this
exactly. It stayed in `tapeRunner` when the world swap was factored out
into `levelRun.js`, because it is a rule about where the AS3 hook sits, not
about the engine.

**Dead frames must not consume tape.** `Game.update` skips `super.update()`
entirely while `blackCover > 0` (~18-20 frames after every world load), and
`Mobile.mobileUpdate` skips the whole friction/input/move block while
`Game.freezeObjects`. Nothing moves on those frames, so the tick counter
gates on both. The fade frame count varies slightly run to run; that is
fine and observed, because dead frames are skipped rather than counted into
the tape. (`collide-up-rock` replayed with 17 fade frames against a
recording made at 18 and still matched exactly.)

### The transitions contract

`transitions` carries the minimal symmetric record
`[{ t, from_level, to_level }]`, where `t` is **the first observation tick
whose `level` is the new level**. Arrival position is already `ticks[t]`
and is not duplicated. Teleporter identity is deliberately **excluded**:
the AS3 bot cannot observe which teleporter fired without a patch, and an
asymmetrically-known field cannot be differentially checked.

**The settled tick order**, transcribed in `tapeFormat.js`'s docblock
because it is a contract both consumers share rather than an
implementation detail. Within one tick:

1. **Teleporters update BEFORE the player.** `World.addUpdate` PREPENDS
   (`World.as:937-947`) and `loadlevel` adds the player (`Game.as:2040`)
   before the teleporters (`:2169`), so a trigger tests the position the
   *previous* tick left — the position this tick starts from.
2. If one fires, the old player still runs this tick's **full movement in
   the old level**: `FP.world = new Game(...)` only records a `_goto`, and
   `Engine.checkWorld` defers the swap to end-of-tick.
3. The swap lands at end-of-tick: a whole new `Game` whose `Player` is
   constructed at **`(playerx + 8, playery + 8)`** (the ctor's half-tile
   offset, on int args) with **zero velocity** and a fresh terrain state,
   while the **held keys carry over** — FlashPunk's `Input` is static and
   no teleport path calls `Input.clear()`.
4. The ~19 `blackCover` frames that follow are dead frames.

**So there is no intermediate observation on a crossing tick.** The last
old-level observation is the first position overlapping the trigger; the
next live observation is already the arrival. Recorded in
`transition-west-return`: tick 60 is level 0 at x = 17.70000000000001, tick
61 is (296, 168) in level 94. The old player's doomed last step is never
observed and never feeds the new player (arrival comes from the
teleporter's own oel attrs), so the model may run that step or skip it —
and that "the stream cannot tell" claim was put to the test: mutating the
engine to skip it turns only its own unit case red. It *is* modelled,
because the game runs it.

**The field is DERIVED, and the derivation lives in one place.**
`botDrain` returns `transitions: []` unconditionally — the game does not
hand the field over and re-recording will never populate it. That forces no
AS3 edit, because the ruling's definition of `t` makes it a pure function
of the tick stream. Three rules hold this up, and all three are
load-bearing:

- the derivation is `tapeFormat.deriveTransitions`, applied by the harness
  on **both** paths (record *and* compare — the live game still reports
  `[]`, so a compare-only derivation would go red);
- the JS engine derives **its** side from its own world swap, never from
  the level field. If both sides read the level field, the transitions diff
  degenerates into diffing the tick stream against itself and checks
  nothing the tick comparison did not already check;
- the harness **checks that `botDrain`'s own field is still empty**, so a
  future AS3 build that starts reporting transitions for real is a named
  failure to reconcile rather than something the derivation silently
  overwrites.

Derivation happens at **record** time rather than compare time, so a
committed expectation states its central claim outright — the re-record
added twelve readable lines to `transition-west-return.json` and nothing
else, and "crosses at 61, comes back at 109" is now reviewable in
`git diff`. The differ compares elements **exactly**, not by count: a
count-only comparison passes a run that crossed the right number of times
in the wrong places.

## The level is injected, never loaded

Nothing in the engine reads the atlas. The caller passes
`levelSource(level) -> record`; `levelSource.js` holds the node-only half
(`atlasLevelSource()`) and `levelSourceFromAtlas(atlas)` is the
browser-usable one. `buildLevelWorld` then transcribes the `loadlevel`
subset over that record, and `tapeRunner` memoises what it builds.

A **record** source rather than a prebuilt world, for two reasons that are
both about transitions: the runner must build worlds for levels nobody
named at call time (a teleporter's `to`), and `buildLevelWorld`'s loud
throws should fire when a run walks INTO a level, naming it, rather than
eagerly for all 116.

`opts.levelSource` also **selects the engine**. Without it you get the v1
engine (stub terrain, no collision), which refuses a `noclip: false` tape
outright; with it you get v2, whose sweep probe is on or off exactly as the
tape says. The v1 five fixtures are run **both** ways, which is what makes
them a regression net rather than five files that happen to still pass.

`levelWorld` is dependency-free and browser-usable: it takes a level
RECORD, not a path, exactly as the other core modules take plain tapes. Two
things about the record itself: tile rows are **tile-space** while entity
x/y are **pixel-space** (the `[x, y, tx, ty]` rows are tiles; `tx` is a
pixel offset into the tileset strip, so `tx/16` is the column), and the
extract has **already applied `loadlevel`'s own out-of-bounds guard**,
recording what it dropped in `tiles_outside_level` (5 for level 0, 506
across 51 levels). Do not re-filter, and do not un-filter.

Level censuses, each reconciled against a hand count of the extract:
level 0 = 400 tiles (397 walkable, 3 solid), 74 solids, 2 pixelmasks, 8
teleporters. Level 94 = 400 tiles (338 walkable), 88 solids, 10
pixelmasks, 2 teleporters.

## The physics, and the things the source will mislead you about

`playerPhysicsV1.js` and `playerPhysicsV2.js` are a transcription, not a
model. Per tick: teleporter triggers → `getState()` → friction/speed
selection → `friction(); input(); moveX(); moveY()` → world clamp → the
end-of-tick swap, if one fired.

1. **`input()` OVERSHOOTS; it is not a clamp.** The branch is
   `if (v.x < moveSpeed) v.x += accel` with `accel === moveSpeed` — a
   threshold test followed by a full-magnitude add. Velocity therefore
   exceeds `moveSpeed` on most ticks and settles into a ~3-tick limit cycle
   (0.80 → 1.35 → 1.10 → 0.85 → 1.40 …) peaking near *twice* the "cap". The
   original design brief described this as "one held frame saturates the
   axis, velocity is effectively binary"; a port written to that diverges
   from the game on tick 1. **The real game confirmed the limit cycle**:
   holding RIGHT it reports `x = 88, 92.09999999999998, 99.15` at ticks
   0/4/10 and the JS engine emits the same doubles.
2. **Friction is VECTOR-length, not per-axis.** `v.normalize(max(v.length -
   f, 0))` then snap components under 0.05 to zero. Both axes accelerate
   independently but only one friction quantum leaves the combined length,
   so a diagonal covers ~√2 the ground of an axis-aligned run. A per-axis
   port diverges the moment both axes move.
3. **`Player` OVERRIDES `Mobile.moveX/moveY`.** The base-class movers are
   dead for the player, so the noclip flag has to live in the Player
   overrides — patching `Mobile` is a silent no-op.
4. **The clamp reads the LEVEL size, not the screen size.** `Game.as:1854`
   overwrites `FP.width`/`FP.height` from the level file on every load, so
   level 0 (`OverWorld.oel`, 320×320) clamps to x ∈ [2,318] — not the
   [2,158] that `Main.as`'s 160×160 screen implies.
5. **The player does not spawn at the constructor's coordinates.**
   `Player.as:357` re-centres onto the tile (`+Tile.w/2, +Tile.h/2`), so
   `new Game(0, 80, 128)` puts the entity at **(88, 136)**. A tape's `boot`
   block carries the *constructor* args and the offset is transcribed on
   top. (v1's "a later level may carry a `<player>` spawn override" caveat
   is RETIRED: no `.oel` in the repo contains one — grep across all 120.)

### Collision: solid geometry is ENTITIES, not a grid

FlashPunk's `Grid`/`Tilemap` masks have zero call sites. `loadlevel` builds
**one `Tile` entity per 16×16 cell** from the `<tiles>` layer via a 45-arm
switch on the tileset column; the entity POSITION is the cell **centre**
and the hitbox covers the cell exactly. Solidity is a **deferred type
flip**: every Tile is constructed `type = "Tile"` and its FIRST update sets
`type = Tile.types[t]`, marking t ∈ {2,9,11,14,15,19,20,23,24,27,34,35,36}
`"Solid"` and leaving everything else — including Water(1), Pit(6),
Lava(17) — walkable. The player's solid list is the base
`["Solid","Tree","Rock","Rope","ShieldBoss"]` plus `"LavaBoss"`, pushed
**unconditionally in the constructor** (`Player.as:355-359`, not a
boss-fight branch) and inert outside Dungeon 7. Transcribe it verbatim.

The sweep is 1-px steps, `collideTypes(solids, x + d, y)` per step, **X
fully resolved before Y**. Facts that only the running game settled:

- **On a hit the loop RETURNS and the caller DISCARDS the entity.**
  Position stays at the last free step and **velocity is NOT zeroed** — it
  persists and decays only through `friction()`. Pressing into a wall is a
  stable, oracle-observable state, and the observation is cheap:
  `collide-up-rock` releases UP at tick 40, holds y = 130.5 through tick 43,
  then creeps −0.45 to **130.05** at tick 44 as friction shrinks the step
  below the remaining gap. An engine that zeroed `v` on contact holds 130.5
  forever.
- **The stop is MID-PIXEL.** `d = min(1, |rel|) * sign` leaves the rest
  position wherever the fractional approach ended — y = 130.5 above.
  Anything that resolves collision to a tile edge or an integer is wrong
  here by half a pixel.
- **Sub-pixel moves DO sweep.** `for (i = 0; i < Math.abs(_xrel); i++)`
  executes for `_xrel = 0.8` (0 < 0.8). A recon sweep claimed otherwise and
  is wrong; v1's bit-exact friction tails had already proved it.
- **The first-tick type flip is modelled** (`beforeTypeFlip`), and only
  TILES are late — every object class assigns its type in its
  *constructor*, `CliffSide` included, so the pixelmask seam and object
  solids are armed on tick 1. The tick is per **WORLD**, not per run: the
  tick after an arrival is the destination world's first live tick, for the
  same reason tape tick 0 is the boot world's. It is genuinely unobservable
  today (a fresh Player moves ≤ 0.8 px and every solid tile type carries the
  plain 0.8 walk speed), which is exactly why it needed a synthetic unit
  case rather than a fixture.
- **`Rectangle.intersects` is positive-area only**, confirmed at the source
  that matters — `SWFModernRuntime/src/avm2/avm2_text.c:8029`, behind an
  isEmpty guard on both rects, the same comparison FlashPunk's
  `Entity.collide` makes. So one `rectsOverlap` predicate legitimately
  serves both the sweep and the terrain gate.

### The terrain resolver

`getState()` (`Player.as:656-668`) is not a pure function of position, and
v1's `terrainStateAt(x, y)` seam could not express it. Four properties,
all transcribed:

- **STICKY.** `state` is assigned only when the candidate tile's rect
  intersects the player's probe rect; otherwise the **previous** state
  persists. It survives nothing except a world swap, which resets it.
- **Nearest WALKABLE tile, by CENTRE distance.** `nearestToPoint` with the
  default `useHitboxes = false` measures squared distance to entity x/y —
  i.e. to tile centres. And solid tiles flipped their type and *left* the
  `"Tile"` list, so `state` can never become a wall type and the nearest
  candidate near a wall may be surprisingly distant.
- **STRICT intersect.** Touching edges with zero overlap area do not
  intersect.
- **`checkOffsetY = 1`.** The probe point is `(x, y + checkOffsetY)` and
  the probe rect is the player's box shifted down by the same 1 px.

**Noclip does not bypass terrain typing.** `getState()` types the tile
under the player every tick independently of collision, and `moveSpeed` is
selected from it — so a `noclip: true` tape that strays onto water or
stairs still produces a loud mismatch rather than hiding the assumption in
a constant. The modelled state set at the v2 rung is the default-speed
grounds plus stairs (10) and ghost step (30); water(1), pit(6), lava(17),
ice(22), waterfall(25) throw when the player stands on one. That is not
squeamishness: water and lava couple `moveSpeed` to **sound state**
(`+0.25 * int(Music.soundPosition("Swim") < 0.1)`), pits set
`receiveInput = false`, and ice rewrites both speed and friction — all v3+
mechanics.

Two things the running code said that no amount of reading had:
**level 0's spawn tile is BRICK (t = 3), not Ground** — the observation
stream cannot tell, because both walk at 0.8, so it is asserted on the
resolver's own answer, a standing reminder that "the streams match" is a
weaker claim than it reads. And **three `MOVE_SPEEDS` comment labels were
wrong** (17 is Lava, 25 is Waterfall, 30 is Ghost Tile Step); the values
were always right, which is why nothing caught them.

## The seams that are loud on purpose

Each of these is a **throw**, not a fallback, and the reason is always the
same shape: an over-throw is a loud "move the fixture", while the quiet
alternative is a divergence nobody sees — or worse, a model that agrees
with the game everywhere the fixtures happen to look.

- **Pixelmask colliders** (Building, TreeLarge, SnowHill, TentacleBeast,
  OpenTree, Statue, **CliffSide**) — a sweep step whose candidate rect
  overlaps one's bounding rect throws "unmodeled pixelmask collider".
  Phase 5a already proved neither rectangle approximation is safe: the
  sprite rect swallows the building's own doorway, a smaller one merges
  rooms. `collidesSolid` throws **unconditionally**, even where a rect
  solid would also have blocked — the bounding rect over-approximates the
  mask, so this can only over-throw. Masks are MIT and extractable in a
  later rung if one is ever needed.
- **Two teleporters firing on one tick.** `FP.world =` only records a
  `_goto`, so the winner is whichever updates LAST — FlashPunk's prepend
  order, which this module deliberately does not transcribe. **Live, not
  theoretical:** level 0's own west pair sits at (0,128) and (0,144), and a
  player whose y lies in (141, 146) has their 5-tall box in both volumes at
  once, with different arrivals (296,168) vs (296,184).
  `transition-west-return` walks the row at y = 136 and misses it by five
  pixels.
- **A teleporter targeting its own level.** The game side derives its
  transitions from the level field, so a same-level teleport is invisible
  there; modelling it would put an entry in the JS stream the oracle could
  never report. Defensive only — 0 of 280 teleporters in the extract
  self-target.
- **An unclassified entity in a level being built.** Add it to
  `ENTITY_CLASSES` with its `Game.as` construction site and its `setHitbox`
  args rather than assuming it does not collide. This one is not an edge
  case, it is the ladder's real gate — see "What's next".
- **An unknown layer name.** `loadlevel` builds `tiles`, `objects` and
  `cliffsides` and nothing else; a layer the extract carries that the game
  never builds is a question about the extractor, not something to skip
  past.
- **Bridge (t = 29) fails at BUILD time**, not from the resolver. Its
  `Tile.types` entry is `"Unused"` because it rewrites its own entity type
  from an opening timer inside `render()`, so it cannot even be sorted into
  the walkable or solid list — the level is unmodellable rather than
  modellable-but-wrong. The merely special terrains (water, pit, lava, ice,
  waterfall) load fine and throw only if the player actually stands on one.

The general rule this arc keeps re-learning: **do not let the JS "clean up"
the game.** The first-tick type-flip ordering, the sticky state, the
discarded collision return, the strict `Rectangle.intersects` — transcribe
them all verbatim and let the oracle arbitrate. Every divergence in v1 and
v2 came from a description that was tidier than the code.

## The driver

`botDriverV2` plans A\* over walkable tiles of the current level, smooths
the waypoint chain, and executes each waypoint with v1's bang-bang
controller driving the **real** `step()` with collision on. Two doctrines
carry over from v1 and are why the file is short: **simulate, don't
solve** (velocity is not proportional to anything convenient, so a closed
form would be a second model of the physics, free to drift), and **the tape
is the artifact** (the tests re-run the emitted tape through `runTape`
independently rather than trusting the planner's running state).

**⚠ The controller is 45°-then-axis, not straight-line. This is the
correction most likely to be re-broken by someone reading the brief's
§3.4**, which says to smooth greedily while the straight *segment* stays
clear. Doing exactly that put a fixture in the lake. The braking rule is
per axis and both axes accelerate by the same quantum under vector
friction, so while both are held they advance at the same rate: the player
leaves a waypoint at **45 degrees** and only straightens out once the
shorter axis arrives. For a shallow leg — dx 128, dy 16 — that is most of
the level: from (104,184) toward (232,200) the straight line is at y = 185
by x = 112 while the player is at y = **192**, over the Water at tile
(7,12), where the terrain assertion fires. `controllerPathClear` models the
two legs actually traversed. It stays approximate in two bounded ways (the
X-first intra-tick corner, and up to one accel quantum of overshoot at a
waypoint, which the 6 px between a tile centre and its edges absorbs), and
the executor's throw is what makes approximation safe.

**The geometry has two faces, and only one may be quiet.** A planner cannot
use `collidesSolid`: routing around an obstacle by catching the exception
that says you already hit it is not routing around it, and one stray probe
aborts the search. `levelWorld.plannerBlockerAt` is the same geometry with
the throw taken off — and **strictly wider**, because it also reports
**unmodelled terrain**, which blocks nothing at all in the game (water is
walkable geometry) but ends a v2 run. A planner asking only about solids
routes straight into the lake. A fourth obstacle kind, **live teleporter
volumes**, is planning POLICY and lives in the driver rather than the
geometry: an in-level route that clipped a trigger would silently end up in
another level — the accident that ate v1's original `clamp-left` fixture.
The one teleporter a leg names as its `exit` is exempt.

**It refuses rather than recovers.** If the simulated run hits a wall en
route to a waypoint, that is a planner bug and it THROWS; it never re-plans
quietly, because silent re-planning is how a divergence hides (the tape
still reaches the target, every assertion passes, and the fact that the
model's geometry disagreed with the game's is never reported). Same for a
transition nobody asked for, a leg that starts in the wrong level, and an
`exit` whose teleporter does not go where the next leg says.

**Cross-level legs**: a task is `[{ level, targets: [...], exit?: {x, y} }]`.
The driver walks the targets, then walks INTO the teleporter whose oel
coordinates are `exit`, and asserts it arrived in the next leg's `level`.
**The caller names the teleporter; the driver never searches the teleporter
graph.** Full auto cross-level routing waits for the rung that needs it —
the maze bot's `(region, arrival-exit)` routing lessons come into scope
then, not now.

**`levelRun.js` is not tidiness.** The driver's copy of a world swap is
what synthesizes the tape the differential then runs through the runner's
copy — two copies would be wrong *together* and the tape would still
reconcile against the game, which is the verifier-shared-assumption trap one
level up. So the swap (arrival offset, zeroed velocity, reset terrain,
pre-armed latch, the destination world's own `beforeTypeFlip` tick) has one
implementation and two callers.

**One property worth stealing for later rungs:** for a *synthesized*
fixture, "the driver still emits this tape" converts any geometry error
into a red, because the PLAN depends on the geometry. That is a strictly
stronger net than a replay-only fixture, and it is how the statue mutation
below gets caught even along a route that avoids the statue.

## Running it

```bash
# 1. dev server at the REPO ROOT (check first — do not double-start)
ss -ltn | grep ":8000" || python3 -m http.server 8000

# 2. the staleness gate: live game vs the committed recordings
node scripts/procgen/verify-seedling-bot-differential.mjs --win

# 3. re-record after a deliberate physics or fixture change
node scripts/procgen/verify-seedling-bot-differential.mjs --record --win \
    --only=collide-up-rock,transition-west-return
```

SKIPs (exit 0) when the wasm artifact is absent, like every other seedling
verifier — CI has no wasm and stays green.

**Always pass `--only=` when recording.** `--record` does not compare
before it writes, so recording one new fixture otherwise rewrites every
already-oracle-recorded expectation on the way past — a genuine drift in a
v1 fixture would be silently baked into the regression net instead of
reported. A misspelled name is a named failure, not a silent empty sweep.
A missing expectation is likewise a named FAIL for that one tape rather
than an exception that aborts the sweep and leaves every later tape
unreported.

### Always pass `--win`

WSL's own Chromium is **SwiftShader (software)**; SWFRecomp-CC's `CLAUDE.md`
is explicit that it must never be used for performance work. Seedling runs
at **~0.5 frames/sec** on it, so a 140-tick tape takes 6½ minutes and a
fixture sweep takes twenty. `--win` drives real-GPU Windows Chrome from WSL
and gets **~25 fps** — the same sweep in ~50 seconds, a ~44x speedup. The
physics is identical either way; a deterministic tick loop does not care
what draws it.

Recipe and interop rules:
SWFRecomp-CC `tools/divergence/perf/WINDOWS_PLAYWRIGHT_FROM_WSL.md`. Two
notes from using it here:

- That doc says to call `python.exe`. On this box it is not on WSL's PATH
  and the WindowsApps entry is an uninstalled Store alias — **`py.exe
  -3.12`** is the working equivalent.
- Windows Python cannot take Linux paths, so the driver and its JSON files
  are staged under `C:\playwright\` (= `/mnt/c/playwright/`).
  `seedling-bot-replay-win.py` is only a browser driver; all fixture and
  diff logic stays on the Linux side so the tape format has one
  implementation.

Each replay prints its WebGPU adapter, so a run that silently fell back to
software rendering is visible rather than just mysteriously slow.

**Every tape gets a fresh page.** `botReset` forgets the tape but cannot
rewind the *game* — the player stays where the last tape left them, so a
second tape on the same page starts from the wrong position and records
plausible garbage.

## Rebuilding the game after an AS3 change

`~/CC/seedling_bot_build/build_bot.sh` builds the SWF; its header documents
the rest (inject → SWFRecomp → `build_wasm_avm2.sh` → `deploy_wasm_avm2.sh`
→ copy into `frontend/modules/flashPanel/wasm/`, which is gitignored).
Budget roughly ten minutes and **batch AS3 edits** — that cost is the entire
reason `Bot.as` is a generic interpreter. Neither v2 slice needed one.

Traps, all real: the `.o` cache keys on mtime not flags, so `FRESH=1` after
any define change; use `run-SWFRecomp.sh` rather than raw SWFRecomp or risk
a WSL2 VM `bad_alloc`; `deploy_wasm_avm2.sh` stages the *teleport* SWF as
`test.swf` unless you pass `DEMO_SWF`; mxmlc strips `trace()` without
`-omit-trace-statements=false`; and mxmlc's flow analysis does not credit
returns inside `try`/`catch`, so such functions need a terminal return.

## Gates, and what would make them vacuous

- **G1 (CI, vitest):** every tape's JS stream equals its committed oracle
  recording, exactly — including element-wise `transitions`. Plus the
  hand-derived physics and geometry cases, a *second* independent stratum,
  since their values come from reading the AS3 rather than from recording
  anything.
- **G2 (local, verify script):** live wasm replay matches the recordings
  across all 11 fixtures, and the live driver task (thread-the-gap plus a
  cross-level leg, 517 ticks planned at run time) lands the real game on
  both targets in two levels with the crossing at the tick the driver
  named — asserted from the **game's own** drained observations, not the
  driver's internal state.

Both are quantitatively pinned (observation counts *and* transition counts
per tape), because every positional assertion is satisfiable by a bot that
teleports. Exactness is deliberate: AS3 `Number`, JS numbers and the
recompiled runtime are all IEEE-754 doubles, so a mismatch is a
transcription defect to investigate, not a tolerance to configure.

The fixture leg is only meaningful while the expectations are **oracle
recordings**. `fixtures/regenerate.mjs` writes `*.provisional.json` from our
own engine, which is a bootstrap for a not-yet-recorded fixture and a change
detector only — a verifier sharing the generator's assumptions verifies
nothing. A test pins that no current fixture is riding that path.

## The bounded vacuities

Five model properties turn **no fixture red** when mutated away. They are
recorded here as one honest list rather than left implied by a green
mutation table, because **the pattern matters more than the instances**:
the fixture roster can only ever see what levels 0 and 94 contain, and
those two levels are benign. Each entry names the concrete witness that
would close it.

| property | what a mutation kills | why no fixture sees it | the witness that would |
|---|---|---|---|
| sticky terrain state | 5 hand-derived | levels 0 and 94 have COMPLETE tile coverage (400/400 cells), so the strict-intersect gate can never fail along any route in them | a reachable **hole** cell: 27 levels have holes, 6 have one 4-adjacent to plain floor (99, 101, 28, 83, 102, 110). Nearest is level 83, a 5×5 room reached 0 → 12 → 83; mid-hole the 4-wide probe sits at x ∈ [6,10) while the nearest walkable tile starts at 16 |
| the teleporter latch | 4 hand-derived | neither arrival in `transition-west-return` lands on a trigger — which is exactly *why* the round trip is two crossings and not a bounce | one of the **four** arrivals in the extract that land ON a trigger: L11(32,0)→L3 onto L3(96,128)→11; L97(32,16)→L37 onto L37(576,144)→97; L88(192,0)→L87 onto L87(432,304)→88; L107(0,48)→L102 onto L102(224,96)→107 |
| terrain state reset on a swap | 1 hand-derived | both arrival tiles walk at 0.8 either way | any transition whose two sides differ in speed |
| the driver's teleporter policy | 2 hand-derived | the only trigger a committed route approaches is the leg's own exit, which is exempt | a target on the far side of a trigger tile, forcing a detour |
| the executor's hit-throw | nothing | it is a **diagnostic, not a detector** — running it together with the wrong statue rect turns the SAME 5 tests red as the statue mutation alone | nothing; keep it anyway, because the alternative (a silent re-plan) is how a model defect becomes a green run |

The A\* tie-break is in the same family: reversing the neighbour order and
dropping the (ty, tx) tie-break both leave everything green, because level
0's routes have no equal-f tie that survives the smoother. The real
cross-run determinism pin is "the committed fixtures are what the driver
emits today" — tapes recorded from the game in another process on another
day.

Until one of those witnesses lands, the only stratum that can see
stickiness is the synthetic hand-built grids in `playerPhysicsV2.test.js`,
and those share the generator's assumptions. Saying so is the point.

**And the two doors out are both shut for the same third reason.** The
boot is baked into the SWF, so an oracle-backed witness needs either
cross-level *walking* or a parameterised boot (an AS3 edit, to batch). But
all six hole-adjacent levels and all four ping-pong levels **fail
`buildLevelWorld`** on unclassified entities, and level 83 additionally
holds a Pit, Water and nine cliffside pixelmasks in a 5×5 room, so its hole
is unreachable at the v2 rung however the player arrives. Recorded so a
later slice does not re-derive it: **cross-level walking from level 0
reaches exactly ONE other level, 94** — every other neighbour throws.

## What's next: the gate is the CLASS TABLE

The honest shape of the ladder above v2, sized rather than asserted:

- **3 of 116 levels build today.**
- **115 distinct unclassified entity tags** across the extract.
- **There is no cheap prefix.** `lightalpha` alone blocks 98 levels, and
  classifying it takes you from 3 levels to 6:

  | classify top N tags | levels that build |
  |---|---|
  | 1 (`lightalpha`) | 6 / 116 |
  | 3 | 10 / 116 |
  | 5 | 12 / 116 |
  | 10 | 16 / 116 |
  | 20 | 27 / 116 |
  | 40 | 44 / 116 |

Most of the 115 are enemies, pickups, puzzle furniture and presentation —
the same mass the v1 port-scope survey put at "Enemies (30+ classes),
bosses, NPCs, presentation" — so classifying them is not a table-filling
exercise so much as the v3/v4/v5 rungs arriving one class at a time.
**The ladder above v2 is gated on entity semantics: not on the boot, not on
pathing, and not on the toolchain.**

Two consequences for any v3 planning: pricing a rung by "which levels does
it need" is a one-line query against `ENTITY_CLASSES` and should be done
BEFORE the rung is scoped; and the census guard's altitude was chosen
correctly — classifying only what fixture levels contain is what has kept
115 tags from being guessed at, and every one of those throws is a rung
boundary made visible rather than a silent non-collider.

Also true, and unpleasant to discover later: **49 of level 0's 152
box-fitting tiles are unreachable from the spawn** — the north field behind
the building, the east corridor, the west sliver. Any coverage claim about
"level 0" should say which 103 tiles it means.

## Two transcription lessons worth generalising

**A tag missing from a table while its twin is present.**
`levelWorld.ENTITY_CLASSES` carried `stairsdown` but not `stairsup`. They
are the same class and the same trigger — `Game.as:2167-2168` differ only in
`Stairs`' third argument, and `_up` picks a sprite frame, a sound index and
a render flag, so the `super(...)` call is byte-identical. The extract holds
**280** triggers (teleporter 228, stairsdown 26, stairsup 26), not the 254 a
census had counted, so `buildLevelWorld` threw on 26 levels and a ping-pong
scan missed a fourth pair. Loud rather than silent, so nothing was ever
*wrong* — but the next slice would have hit it immediately. **The guard is a
census WIDER than the fixture levels**: every `teleporter`/`stairs*` tag in
all 116 levels must be a classified trigger, because triggers define the
LEVEL GRAPH, and a missing one there is not a loud throw somewhere useful —
it is an exit that silently does not exist until something tries to stand on
it.

**An offset applied at one level of a constructor chain but not the next.**
`Statue` is the only class in the table that adds an offset on top of NPC's
own constructor: `Statue` passes `(_x + Tile.w, _y - Tile.h/2 + ...)`
(+16, −8) and `NPC` then adds its own (+8, +8). The transcription applied
the first and stopped, putting level 0's statue collider 8 px up and left.
Nothing found it for two slices; the first `thread-the-gap` recording did,
when the game pinned x at **181.17065141119556** against a left edge at 184
the model did not have while the JS strolled through. Two things to carry:
the slice that introduced it noted the statue "sits far from any fixture
route", which was true of the v1 routes — **"unobservable" decays the moment
the driver gets better**; and with the route now planned *around* the
statue, no synthesized fixture touches it, which is why `statue-press`
exists (a planned approach plus a hand-authored 40-tick press into the edge;
the press tile is not even a legal A\* goal, so it could not have been
synthesized). Settled in passing: the statue's `setHitbox` comes from
`render()`, and unlike the Tile type flip that is NOT a first-tick subtlety
— `render` is driven by the Engine independently of `Game.update`'s
`blackCover` gate, so the fade frames have all rendered before tick 0.

## Dead ends, recorded so nobody re-chases them

- **A black canvas means nothing here.** The untouched teleport page also
  reads 0% non-black under headless WebGPU; it is the readback, not the
  game.
- **`A valid external Instance reference no longer exists`**, repeated every
  frame, is just an unconfigured `BridgeGeneric`. It appears in the teleport
  build too and is unrelated to whether the game is ticking.
- **A fixed replay timeout looks exactly like a dead bot.** At ~0.5 fps the
  `blackCover` fade alone outlasts a 60s deadline, which is how the first
  run presented and where most of the diagnosis time went. Deadlines scale
  with tape length.
- **The world clamp is unreachable in level 0.** The original `clamp-left`
  fixture walked far enough left that the game loaded an adjacent level —
  the recording showed `level=94` at tick 61 — so it was silently testing
  room transitions. It was replaced by `shuffle-stop`; the clamp keeps its
  hand-derived unit case. The `level` field in the observation stream is
  what caught this, which is why v1 carries it.
- **Cutscenes are already skipped**, and not by accident: the intro cutscene
  fires only from the `level < 0` branch (`Game.as:765-773`), and the
  cherry-picked teleport boot passes an explicit level 0. The bot reports
  `receive_input`/`saw_input_refused` in `botStatus` rather than stalling,
  so a cutscene that *did* fire would be named rather than silent.
- **`Tree`'s private `solids` list is DEAD CODE** — `Tree extends Entity`
  (not `Mobile`), is `active = false`, and the identifier is used nowhere in
  the file. It is vestigial, not an override.
- **`Moonrock` does not block**, `Torch` and `Orb` never assign a type at
  all, and **a tagged, non-inverted teleporter is DEACTIVATED on a fresh
  boot** (`tag >= 0 && (!checkPersistence(tag) == invert)`: every
  persistence flag is `true`, so `!checkPersistence` is false and
  `invert == false` deactivates it). Counter-intuitive, and a second reason
  fixtures stay off tagged teleporters — level 0's are all `tag = -1`.
- **`getStatePos` (`Player.as:670-678`) is a different function** — no
  intersect gate, returns −1. Do not conflate it with `getState`.
- **Tile constructors call `Math.random()`** for animation offsets. Cosmetic;
  there is no movement RNG at this rung. Do not model it.
- **`nearestToPoint` ties resolve by entity-list order.** If a fixture ever
  lands on an equidistant pair, move the fixture rather than transcribing
  FlashPunk's list order.
