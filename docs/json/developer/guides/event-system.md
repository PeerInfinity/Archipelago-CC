# Developer Guide: The Event System

To maintain a decoupled and modular architecture, the frontend relies on a two-tier event system for communication between modules. Understanding when and how to use each tier is crucial for developing new features.

The two tiers are:

1.  **The Event Bus (`eventBus.js`):** For simple, broadcast-style notifications.
2.  **The Event Dispatcher (`eventDispatcher.js`):** For prioritized, command-like events that should be handled by a specific module in a defined order.

## Tier 1: The Event Bus

The `eventBus` is a simple publish-subscribe (pub/sub) system. It allows modules to broadcast notifications without knowing or caring who, if anyone, is listening.

**Analogy:** Think of it as a public announcement system. A module makes an announcement, and any other module that has chosen to listen for that specific type of announcement will hear it.

### When to Use the Event Bus

Use the Event Bus for **one-to-many** or **many-to-many** communication, typically for broadcasting state changes or general UI notifications.

-   A core service's state has changed, and multiple UI panels need to react and update their display (e.g., `stateManager:snapshotUpdated`, `settings:changed`).
-   A user action has occurred that multiple, unrelated panels might be interested in (e.g., `ui:activatePanel`).
-   A general notification needs to be displayed to the user (e.g., `ui:notification`).

### How to Use the Event Bus

```javascript
// --- Publishing an event ---
// Module A (e.g., the StateManager proxy) wants to announce a state update.
import eventBus from '../../app/core/eventBus.js';

eventBus.publish('stateManager:snapshotUpdated', { snapshot: newSnapshotData }, 'stateManager');
```

```javascript
// --- Subscribing to an event ---
// Module B (e.g., a UI panel) wants to listen for state updates.
import eventBus from '../../app/core/eventBus.js';

class ModuleB_UI {
  constructor() {
    // It's best practice to subscribe in the constructor or onMount.
    // The module's ID ('moduleB') is passed for tracking and debugging.
    this.unsubscribeHandle = eventBus.subscribe(
      'stateManager:snapshotUpdated',
      (data) => {
        console.log('Module B received snapshot:', data.snapshot);
        this.render(); // Re-render the UI with the new data
      },
      'moduleB' 
    );
  }

  // It's critical to unsubscribe when the component is destroyed to prevent memory leaks.
  // Golden Layout will call this method when the panel is closed.
  destroy() {
    if (this.unsubscribeHandle) {
      this.unsubscribeHandle();
    }
  }
}
```

## Tier 2: The Event Dispatcher

The `eventDispatcher` is a more sophisticated system designed for handling events that should be processed in a specific, prioritized order. It sends an event down a "chain of command," and the first eligible module that handles it can stop the event from propagating further.

**Analogy:** Think of it as escalating a request through a chain of command. The request goes to the highest-priority manager first. If they can't handle it, they pass it to the next one in line, and so on.

### When to Use the Event Dispatcher

Use the Event Dispatcher for user actions or system commands that require a **single, authoritative handler**.

-   A user clicks a location to check it (`user:locationCheck`). This event needs to be routed correctly:
    1.  Should the `Loops` module handle it and queue an action?
    2.  If not, should the `Client` module handle it and send the check to the server?
    3.  If not, should the `StateManager` handle it locally for offline tracking?
-   The dispatcher ensures that only one of these modules acts on the event, based on their `loadPriority` defined in `module-configs/modules.json`.

### How to Use the Event Dispatcher

Modules must register their intent to handle a dispatched event during the [registration phase](./module-system.md). The dispatcher uses the `loadPriority` to determine the order.

1.  **Registering a Handler (in `module/index.js` `register()` function):**

    ```javascript
    // In loops/index.js
    registrationApi.registerDispatcherReceiver(
      'loops', // Module ID
      'user:locationCheck', // Event name
      handleUserLocationCheckForLoops, // The handler function
      { direction: 'up', condition: 'conditional', timing: 'immediate' } // Propagation details
    );
    ```

2.  **Dispatching an Event (from a UI element):**

    ```javascript
    // In locationsUI.js, when a location card is clicked
    // The dispatcher instance is retrieved via the module's initialization API.
    const dispatcher = getDispatcher(); 
    dispatcher.publish(
      'locations', // Originating Module ID
      'user:locationCheck',
      { locationName: "Link's House" },
      { initialTarget: 'bottom' } // Start with the last-loaded, highest-priority module
    );
    ```

3.  **Handling and Propagating (in the handler function):**

    ```javascript
    // In loops/loopEvents.js
    export function handleUserLocationCheckForLoops(eventData, propagationOptions) {
      const dispatcher = getLoopsModuleDispatcher();

      if (loopStateSingleton.isLoopModeActive) {
        // Handle the event here...
        console.log('Loop mode is active, queuing the check.');
        // Do NOT propagate further. The chain stops here.
      } else {
        // Not handled by this module, so pass it on.
        dispatcher.publishToNextModule(
          'loops', // My module ID
          'user:locationCheck', // The event I'm propagating
          eventData, // The original data
          { direction: 'up' } // Continue in the same direction
        );
      }
    }
    ```

### Summary: `eventBus` vs. `eventDispatcher`

| Characteristic        | Event Bus (`eventBus`)                             | Event Dispatcher (`dispatcher`)                           |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Communication**     | One-to-many (Broadcast)                            | One-to-one-in-a-chain (Prioritized Command)               |
| **Purpose**           | Announcing state changes, general notifications    | Processing user actions, delegating commands              |
| **Handler Execution** | **All** subscribers are called.                    | **Only the highest-priority** eligible handler is called. |
| **Propagation**       | Implicitly goes to all subscribers.                | Must be **explicitly propagated** by the handler.         |
| **Typical Use Case**  | `stateManager:snapshotUpdated`, `settings:changed` | `user:locationCheck`, `user:itemCheck`                    |
