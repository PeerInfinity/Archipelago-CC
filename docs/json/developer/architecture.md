# System Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the technical architecture for the Archipelago JSON Export Tools project. It is intended to give developers a conceptual understanding of the main components and how they interact.

## Core Components

The project consists of two primary, distinct components:

1.  **Backend Exporter (Python):** A command-line tool that analyzes the game logic within the main Archipelago Python codebase and exports it to a structured JSON format.
2.  **Frontend Web Client (JavaScript):** A single-page web application that consumes the exported JSON to provide a powerful, modular interface for game tracking and other utilities.

## Backend Architecture: The Exporter

The exporter is a suite of Python scripts located in the `exporter/` directory. Its sole purpose is to convert Python-based game definitions into a machine-readable JSON format that the frontend can understand.

- **AST Analysis (`exporter/analyzer.py`):** The core of the exporter uses Python's `ast` (Abstract Syntax Tree) module. It ingests Python rule functions (typically `lambda` expressions) and traverses their structure to convert Python logic into a corresponding JSON tree structure.
- **Game-Specific Handlers (`exporter/games/`):** Each game (like `alttp.py`) has a handler that understands its unique helper functions, item properties, and data structures, ensuring they are correctly represented in the final JSON.
- **Orchestration (`exporter/exporter.py`):** The main script coordinates the process, extracting the full region graph, location lists, item definitions, and game settings, and then uses the analyzer to process all associated rules.

## Frontend Architecture: The Web Client

The frontend is a highly modular, single-page application designed for performance, flexibility, and extensibility. It operates without a traditional backend server, running entirely in the user's browser and interacting with Archipelago servers via WebSockets.

### Key Design Principles

1.  **Modularity:** Every distinct feature or UI panel is a self-contained **Module**. This allows features to be enabled, disabled, or even loaded dynamically.
2.  **Performance via Web Workers:** All heavy computation, primarily game rule evaluation and accessibility analysis (BFS), is offloaded to a **Web Worker**. This keeps the main UI thread responsive and prevents freezing during complex state updates.
3.  **Event-Driven Communication:** Modules are decoupled and communicate through an **Event Bus** and a prioritized **Event Dispatcher**. This prevents direct dependencies and allows for flexible interaction patterns.
4.  **Configuration over Code:** The application's behavior, including which modules are loaded and how the UI is arranged, is controlled by a set of JSON configuration files (`modes.json`, `modules.json`, `settings.json`).

### Core Architectural Layers

#### 1. Initialization and Module System (`init.js`)

`init.js` is the main entry point for the frontend. It orchestrates the entire application startup process in a well-defined sequence:

1.  **Mode Detection:** Determines the active mode (e.g., `default`, `test`) from URL parameters or `localStorage`.
2.  **Configuration Loading:** Loads `modes.json`, `modules.json`, `settings.json`, and `layout_presets.json` based on the active mode.
3.  **Module Loading & Registration:** Dynamically imports all JavaScript modules defined in `modules.json`. Each module's `register()` function is called, allowing it to declare its capabilities (e.g., panel components, event handlers) to the `centralRegistry`.
4.  **UI Setup:** Initializes Golden Layout and registers all panel components provided by the modules.
5.  **Module Initialization:** Calls the `initialize()` and `postInitialize()` functions on each enabled module in a defined priority order, providing them with necessary APIs to interact with the system.

#### 2. State Management (The `stateManager` Module)

This is the most critical component of the frontend. It manages all game-related state and logic.

```
  Main UI Thread                    Web Worker Thread
┌───────────────────┐               ┌───────────────────┐
│   UI Components   │               │                   │
│ (e.g., Locations) │               │   StateManager    │
└─────────▲─────────┘               │ (Authoritative)   │
          │                         └─────────┬─────────┘
          │ (Read Snapshots)                  │ (Computes)
          │                                   │
┌─────────▼─────────┐   Commands    ┌─────────▼─────────┐
│ StateManagerProxy │◄─────────────►│    Rule Engine    │
│  (Cached State)   │ (postMessage) │ (Rule Evaluation) │
└───────────────────┘               └───────────────────┘
```

- **`StateManager` (in Worker):** The authoritative source of game state. It holds the inventory, tracks checked locations, and runs the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to determine region reachability. It lives exclusively inside the Web Worker.
- **`RuleEngine` (in Worker):** A JavaScript engine that evaluates the JSON rule trees against the current game state provided by the `StateManager`.
- **`StateManagerProxy` (on Main Thread):** A singleton that acts as the sole interface for all other modules. It sends commands (like `addItem` or `checkLocation`) to the worker and receives state **snapshots** in return. It maintains a cached copy of the latest snapshot for the UI to read from instantly.
- **Snapshots:** Immutable, read-only copies of the game state that are passed from the worker to the main thread. This prevents the UI from directly modifying state and ensures data consistency.

#### 3. UI and Layout Management

- **Golden Layout:** A powerful library used to create the dockable, multi-panel user interface. It handles the creation, destruction, resizing, and arrangement of all panels.
- **`PanelManager`:** A core service that acts as an intermediary, registering UI component classes from modules with the Golden Layout instance. It provides a standardized way for the application to interact with the layout system.
- **Module UI Classes:** Each UI panel (e.g., `InventoryUI`, `LocationUI`) is a JavaScript class responsible for rendering its own HTML content and handling user interactions within its panel.
