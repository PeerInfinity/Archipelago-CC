# Universal Tracker Modifications

This document describes the modifications made to the Universal Tracker compared to the original from [FarisTheAncient/Archipelago](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago) (tracker branch).

- **Original version:** v0.2.26
- **Modified version:** v0.2.23-modified (based on earlier version with extensive additions)
- **Location in this repository:** `worlds/tracker/`
- **Original copy for comparison:** `scripts/test/fixtures/tracker_original/`
- **Last compared:** 2026-02-03

## Summary of Changes

The modifications extend Universal Tracker with:
1. **Pickle-based multiworld loading** for fast tracking without regeneration
2. **Worldgen world integration** for rule explain support
3. **Direct AST rule explanation** from JSON rules files
4. **UT comparison testing infrastructure** for automated verification
5. **Debug logging and sphere log output** for test analysis
6. **Multiworld fuzz testing** via `MultiworldHook` class
7. **ALttP entrance shuffle seed handling** for deterministic regeneration
8. **Fractional sphere logic** option for finer-grained sphere comparison

These changes integrate UT with the JSON Export system, allowing it to explain rules for any world that has exported rules, not just worlds with native Rule Builder support. The pickle mode provides the fastest tracking by loading a serialized multiworld directly.

### Backported from v0.2.26

The following bug fixes and features were backported from upstream v0.2.26:

1. **`glitches_state` field** - Added to `CurrentTrackerState` for separate glitch logic tracking (prevents contaminating main state)
2. **Nothing items fix** - Added `and location.item is not None` check to prevent crashes when events have no item
3. **Glitches state copy** - Create a copy of state before applying glitch items (`glitches_state = state.copy()`)

---

## Architecture

The modified Universal Tracker uses a **mixin-based architecture** to separate our extensions from the upstream code, making it easier to merge upstream updates.

```
worlds/tracker/
├── __init__.py              # Exports (matches upstream)
├── TrackerCoreBase.py       # Original UT TrackerCore (close to upstream v0.2.26)
├── TrackerCore.py           # Extended TrackerCore (combines base + mixins)
├── pickle_mixin.py          # Pickle-based multiworld loading
├── worldgen_mixin.py        # Worldgen and AST explain methods
├── tracker_extensions.py    # Testing mode extensions
├── TrackerClient.py         # Client code (minor modifications)
└── fuzzer_hook.py           # Fuzzer hook for UT comparison testing
```

### Class Hierarchy

```python
class TrackerCore(PickleMixin, WorldgenMixin, TrackerTestingMixin, TrackerCoreBase):
    """Extended TrackerCore with pickle, worldgen, and testing support."""
```

### Tracking Mode Priority

TrackerCore supports four tracking modes, tried in order. See the [UT Tracking Modes Reference](../reference/ut-tracking-modes.md) for full details on each mode and its limitations.

**Legacy order (no config file):**
1. **Pickle** - Fastest, loads serialized multiworld with exact lambdas
2. **Worldgen** - Generates world from JSON rules
3. **Original Seeded** - Original UT YAML-based regeneration with the resolved seed number injected for determinism (reverse lookup covers seeds 1–100 only)
4. **Original (YAML)** - Original upstream UT behavior with a random internal seed

When `exporter/tracking-mode-config.json` is present, the order is driven by its `fallback_order` key and per-game `game_results`.

### Benefits

1. **Easy upstream merging**: Update `TrackerCoreBase.py` directly from upstream
2. **Clear separation**: Extensions are in separate mixin files
3. **Testability**: Can test base vs. extended separately
4. **Documentation**: Extensions are obviously separate from upstream code

**Lines:** 513 (matches upstream v0.2.26)

This file contains the original TrackerCore code from upstream, with minimal changes:
- Class renamed to `TrackerCoreBase` for inheritance
- Backported `glitches_state` fix from v0.2.26
- Backported "Nothing items" fix from v0.2.26

### `TrackerCore.py` (Extended Version)

**Lines:** ~280

This file extends TrackerCoreBase with our modifications via mixins.

### `worldgen_mixin.py`

**Lines:** ~400

Contains worldgen world integration and AST explain support.

#### New Instance Variables

```python
# Worldgen world support
self.worldgen_builder: Optional["JSONWorldBuilder"] = None

- Removed `glitches_state` field from `CurrentTrackerState` namedtuple

```python
# Original
class CurrentTrackerState(NamedTuple):
    ...
    glitches_state: Optional[CollectionState]

# Modified - glitches_state removed
class CurrentTrackerState(NamedTuple):
    ...
    state: Optional[CollectionState]  # Last field, no glitches_state
```

#### `_is_enabled()` — settings cache poison fix (2026-05-09)

The launcher Component is registered conditionally on a host.yaml flag:

```python
if _is_enabled():
    components.append(Component("Universal Tracker", ...))
```

Previously, `_is_enabled()` called `get_settings().universal_tracker` to read the
flag. That triggers `Settings.__getattribute__`, which calls `settings._update_cache()`
to populate the world-settings name cache. Because `_is_enabled()` runs at
*module-load time* during `worlds/__init__.py`'s alphabetical world load,
`_update_cache()` iterates an `AutoWorldRegister` that contains only the worlds
loaded so far (alphabetically through `tracker`). The function then sets
`_world_settings_name_cache_updated = True` in its `finally` block — permanently
freezing the cache against an incomplete registry.

The downstream effect: every world loaded after `tracker` (`tunic`, `ut_pickle`,
`wargroove`, `yoshisisland`, `yugioh06`, `zillion`) was missing from the cache.
When `World.settings` was later accessed for any of them, `Settings.__getattribute__`
fell through and returned the raw `dict` from host.yaml instead of upcasting to the
world's `Group` subclass. `test/general/test_settings.py::TestSettings::test_settings_can_update`
SUBFAILed on `'UT Pickle Mode'` because `TrackerWorld.settings` was a `dict`,
not a `TrackerSettings(Group)`.

The fix reads the raw stored value via `get_settings().__dict__.get('universal_tracker')`,
which bypasses `Settings.__getattribute__` entirely (the `__dict__` slot lookup
short-circuits the upcast machinery) and leaves the cache un-built until something
that genuinely needs it runs. The same pattern was applied to
[`worlds/ut_pickle/__init__.py`](../../../../worlds/ut_pickle/__init__.py); see
[ut_pickle/diff-explanation.md](ut_pickle/diff-explanation.md) for the parallel
change.

## Integration with JSON Export System

The key integration points are:

### 1. Auto-Discovery of Pickle/JSON

When a seed name is set (from server connection), UT auto-discovers tracking files in order:

```python
# In TrackerCore
self.seed_name = "14089154938208861744"  # From RoomInfo
self.auto_discover_pickle()     # Tries frontend/presets/{game}/AP_{seed}/AP_{seed}.pkl.gz first
self.auto_discover_rules_json() # Falls back to AP_{seed}_rules.json
```

### 2. Pickle Loading (Fastest)

For fastest tracking, load the multiworld directly from pickle:

```python
tracker.load_multiworld_from_pickle("path/to/AP_seed.pkl.gz")
tracker.initialize_tracking_from_pickle()
# Tracking uses exact original rules - no conversion needed
```

### 3. Worldgen World Loading

For full rule explain support, a worldgen world can be loaded:

```python
tracker.load_worldgen_world("path/to/rules.json")
# Now explain_location_rule() uses Rule Builder's explain system
```

### 4. Direct AST Explain Fallback

Even without a worldgen world, rules can be explained directly from JSON:

```python
tracker.load_rules_json("path/to/rules.json")
# explain_location_rule() parses AST from JSON
```

---

## Testing Infrastructure

### UT Comparison Testing

The modifications enable automated testing that compares UT's sphere calculations against the original game's sphere log:

1. **Sphere log output**: UT can output its sphere calculations to a JSONL file
2. **Debug logging**: Detailed event logging for debugging mismatches
3. **Test sync protocol**: Bounce-based protocol for test driver communication

### Fuzzer Integration

The extended `fuzzer_hook.py` enables:
- Running UT against fuzzed generations
- Collecting explain coverage statistics
- Identifying worlds with explain gaps

---

## Usage Examples

### Loading from pickle (fastest)

```python
from worlds.tracker import TrackerCore

tracker = TrackerCore.TrackerCore(logger, False, False)
tracker.load_multiworld_from_pickle("frontend/presets/tunic/AP_123/AP_123.pkl.gz")
tracker.initialize_tracking_from_pickle()

# Tracking uses exact original rules
```

### Loading worldgen for explain support

```python
from worlds.tracker import TrackerCore

tracker = TrackerCore.TrackerCore(logger, False, False)
tracker.load_worldgen_world("frontend/presets/tunic/AP_123/AP_123_rules.json")

# Now can explain rules
explanation = tracker.explain_location_rule("Fortress - East Shortcut", state)
```

### Auto-discovering pickle/JSON

```python
tracker.seed_name = "14089154938208861744"
# Try pickle first (fastest), then JSON
if tracker.auto_discover_pickle():
    # Pickle loaded, fast tracking available
    pass
elif tracker.auto_discover_rules_json():
    # Rules JSON loaded, explain available
    pass
```

## Fixes to Original Copy

The original copy in `scripts/test/fixtures/tracker_original/` has been modified to fix issues that prevent linting or testing:

### `TrackerClient.py`

**F-string quote syntax (lines 478, 480, 482):** Changed double quotes to single quotes inside f-string expressions for Python < 3.12 compatibility.

```python
# Original (syntax error in Python < 3.12)
f"Go mode: [color={get_ut_color("in_logic")}]Yes[/color]"

# Fixed
f"Go mode: [color={get_ut_color('in_logic')}]Yes[/color]"
```
