## Notes

- *Italic game names* are in the exclude list for this test type
- **Result:** ✅ if all fuzz runs passed (0 failures, 0 timeouts), ❌ otherwise
- **Total:** Number of fuzz runs attempted for this game
- **Success:** Number of runs where UT matched Python sphere log
- **Failure:** Number of runs where UT mismatched or encountered errors
- **Timeout:** Number of runs that exceeded the time limit
- **Ignored:** Number of runs skipped due to option errors
- **Success Rate:** Percentage of successful runs

### About This Test

The UT fuzzer tests Universal Tracker compatibility by:
1. Generating random game configurations (YAML options)
2. Creating an Archipelago seed with those options
3. Exporting the seed to JSON rules
4. Regenerating the world using the world generator
5. Comparing UT's accessibility calculations to the Python sphere log

Failures indicate that for certain option combinations, UT's logic differs from Python's logic. This helps identify edge cases that need fixing.

## Excluded Templates

These templates are excluded from testing:

| Template | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| APWorld Manager.yaml | Not a game. |
| Archipelago.yaml | Not a game. |
| Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Supporting this game through WorldGen might not be possible. |
| Celeste (Open World).yaml | Temporarily excluded. Supporting this game through WorldGen might not be possible. |
| DOOM 1993.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Helper references original module data (Maps.map_names, self.all_boss_levels, self.included_episodes, Locations.location_table) causing NameError. |
| DOOM II.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Same pattern as DOOM 1993 — helper references original module data (Maps.map_names) causing NameError. |
| Heretic.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Same pattern as DOOM 1993 — helper references original module data (Maps.map_names) causing NameError. |
| JSON Tools Installer.yaml | Not a game. |
| Journey to Ascension.yaml | JtA is not compatible with WorldGen. |
| Kingdom Hearts 2.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Supporting this game through WorldGen might not be possible. |
| Kingdom Hearts.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Supporting this game through WorldGen might not be possible. |
| Kirby's Dream Land 3.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Supporting this game through WorldGen might not be possible. |
| Lingo.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Supporting this game through WorldGen might not be possible. |
| Muse Dash.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Block-bodied helper inlined into expression context causes SyntaxError. |
| Paint.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Helper paint_percent_available not in JSON helpers dict causing NameError (calculate_paint_percent_available is present but referenced under wrong name). |
| Raft.yaml | Temporarily excluded. The WorldGen spoiler test times out at 300 seconds. |
| Satisfactory.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Calls self.state_logic.can_produce_all() which resolves to state.has_all() but is not exported, causing AttributeError. |
| Secret of Evermore.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Supporting this game through WorldGen might not be possible. |
| Starcraft 2.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Supporting this game through WorldGen might not be possible. |
| Stardew Valley.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Supporting this game through WorldGen might not be possible. |
| Super Metroid.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Supporting this game through WorldGen might not be possible. |
| TUNIC.yaml | Temporarily excluded. Supporting this game through WorldGen might not be possible. |
| The Witness.yaml | Temporarily excluded. The WorldGen spoiler test takes 261 seconds. |
