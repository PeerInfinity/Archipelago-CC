## Notes

- *Italic game names* are in the exclude list for this test type
- **Result:** ✅ if all fuzz runs passed (0 failures, 0 timeouts), ❌ otherwise
- **Total:** Number of fuzz runs attempted for this game
- **Success:** Number of runs where UT matched Python sphere log
- **Failure:** Number of runs where UT mismatched or encountered errors
- **Timeout:** Number of runs that exceeded the time limit
- **Ignored:** Number of runs skipped due to option errors
- **Success Rate:** Percentage of successful runs

### About This Test

The UT fuzzer tests Universal Tracker compatibility by:
1. Generating random game configurations (YAML options)
2. Creating an Archipelago seed with those options
3. Exporting the seed to JSON rules
4. Regenerating the world using the world generator
5. Comparing UT's accessibility calculations to the Python sphere log

Failures indicate that for certain option combinations, UT's logic differs from Python's logic. This helps identify edge cases that need fixing.
