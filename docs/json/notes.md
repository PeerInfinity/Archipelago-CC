# Notes & Tips

This document contains useful notes, tips, and clarifications for using the JSON web client, especially regarding the interplay between different modes and less obvious features.

## Starting Loop Mode

There are two ways to activate Archipelago Loops:

1.  **Via the Interface:**

    - Visit the main JSON Web CLient page: [https://peerinfinity.github.io/Archipelago/](https://peerinfinity.github.io/Archipelago/)
    - Click the **"Loops"** radio button (near the top right).
    - Click the **"Enter Loop Mode"** button that appears in the controls below the radio buttons.

2.  **Via Direct Link:**
    - Use this URL to load directly into Loop Mode: [https://peerinfinity.github.io/Archipelago/index.html?mode=loop](https://peerinfinity.github.io/Archipelago/index.html?mode=loop)

## Using "Quick Check" and "Begin!" (Automation)

The **`Quick Check`** and **`Begin!`** buttons located in the center console panel offer automation capabilities:

These buttons work in **all modes** (Standard Mode with Loop Mode off, or with Loop Mode on). They also function whether you are connected to an Archipelago server or playing offline.

- **`Quick Check` Button:**
  - Finds the next available, unchecked location based on your current inventory and rules.
  - Simulates clicking on that location's card (see "Clicking Locations & Exits" below for mode-specific behavior).
- **`Begin!` Button:**
  - Starts a timer that automatically triggers the `Quick Check` functionality at fixed or random intervals.
  - The timer delay can be configured using the `/set_delay` console command.
  - Clicking the button again when the timer is running will stop it.

## Console Commands

The console in the center panel accepts commands:

- `/set_delay [min] [max]`: Sets the minimum and maximum delay (in seconds) for the `Begin!` button's timer. Use one number (e.g., `/set_delay 30`) for a fixed delay.
- `/help`: Displays a list of available console commands.

These console commands (and some others listed by `/help`) work even when not connected to a server.

## Clicking Locations & Exits (in Tabs)

How clicking on items in the main **Locations** and **Exits** tabs (right panel) behaves depends on whether Loop Mode is active:

- **Loop Mode OFF (Standard Mode):**

  - Clicking a **Location card**: Performs an immediate check for that location (sends to server if connected, processes locally if offline).
  - Clicking an **Exit card**: Does nothing.

- **Loop Mode ON:**

  - Clicking a **Location card** (Undiscovered): Queues an **Explore action** for that location's region in the Loop Panel.
  - Clicking a **Location card** (Discovered & Accessible): Queues a **Check Location action** for that specific location in the Loop Panel.
  - Clicking an **Exit card** (Undiscovered): Queues an **Explore action** for that exit's region in the Loop Panel.
  - Clicking an **Exit card** (Discovered & Accessible): Queues a **Move action** using that exit in the Loop Panel.

- **Server Connection Impact:**
  - _Connected:_ Location checks and resulting item acquisitions are synced with the Archipelago server.
  - _Disconnected:_ All checks and actions only affect the local data stored in your browser.

## Clickable Links

The underlined Region and Location names are clickable links. Clicking on them will open the Regions panel and scroll to the relevant region.

## Pause Button

If nothing is happening in Loop Mode, that's probably because the game is paused. Press the Resume button to resume the game.

## Hide Console

There is a button on the top right of the Console panel to hide the Console. The button to show the Console will then appear in the top right of the Inventory panel. The Console panel is hidden by default on small screens.

## Other Tips

- **Remove Inventory Item:** Hold **SHIFT** and click an item in the Inventory panel (left) to remove it or decrease its count. This only affects your local state and is mainly used for testing.
