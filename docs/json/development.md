# Development Documentation

## Vision

Create a robust system for using Archipelago's location access rules in web-based applications, enabling:

- Accurate client-side location checking
- Development of new web interfaces
- Enhanced testing capabilities

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Rule Export System

- Converts Python rule functions to standardized JSON format
- Preserves helper function references
- Handles complex rule patterns including boolean operations, method calls, and conditional expressions

#### 2. Frontend Implementation

- Evaluates rules using native JavaScript helper functions
- Manages inventory and state
- Provides rule debugging capabilities
- Supports game-specific logic through helpers

#### 3. Testing Infrastructure

- Automated test execution via Playwright
- Comprehensive debug logging
- Test result analysis and reporting

### Rule Processing Flow

1. Backend (Python)

   - Analyzer parses rule functions using AST
   - Converts to standardized JSON structure
   - Preserves helper function references
   - Exports complete ruleset

2. Frontend (JavaScript)
   - Loads exported rules
   - Implements helper functions natively
   - Evaluates rules using helper infrastructure
   - Maintains game state and inventory

### Supported Rule Types

1. Basic Rules

   - `item_check`: Direct item requirements
   - `count_check`: Item quantity requirements
   - `helper`: Preserved helper function references
   - `group_check`: Item group requirements
   - `constant`: Static boolean values

2. Composite Rules

   - `and`: Multiple required conditions
   - `or`: Alternative conditions
   - `comparison`: Numeric comparisons
   - `state_method`: State method calls

3. Special Rules
   - Conditional expressions
   - Nested helper calls
   - Progressive item handling
   - State flags and methods

## Development Status

### Working Features

- Complete rule analysis and export
- Helper function preservation and execution
- Inventory and state management
- Automated testing infrastructure
- Debug logging system
- Test result analysis

### Enhanced Analyzer Capabilities

The analyzer now properly handles:

- Complex lambda expressions
- Nested parentheses
- Multiline rules
- Method chains
- String literals and escaping
- Conditional expressions
- Return statements
- Boolean operations

### Debug Infrastructure

The debug system provides:

- Rule evaluation traces
- Inventory state logs
- Helper function execution logs
- Test execution details
- Step-by-step rule processing
- Performance metrics

### Test Results Structure

Results are now organized as:

```javascript
{
  summary: {
    total: number,
    passed: number,
    failed: number,
    percentage: number
  },
  results: [{
    location: string,
    result: {
      passed: boolean,
      message: string,
      expectedAccess: boolean,
      requiredItems: string[],
      excludedItems: string[]
    },
    debugLog: LogEntry[]
  }]
}
```

## Technical Details

### JSON Export Format Version 3

The rule export system now uses a comprehensive region-based format that includes:

- Complete region graph with entrances and exits
- Dungeon and shop data
- Game mode and settings
- Start region information
- Enhanced item and progression data

This format is fully documented in `frontend/assets/types/alttp.d.ts` and replaces the previous location-based format.

### Debug Log Format

```javascript
{
  timestamp: string,
  message: string,
  data?: any,
  trace?: {
    type: string,
    rule: Rule,
    result: boolean,
    children: Trace[]
  }
}
```
