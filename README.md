# Archipelago JSON Export Tools (Claude Code Fork)

This repository is a fork of [PeerInfinity/Archipelago (JSONExport branch)](https://github.com/PeerInfinity/Archipelago/tree/JSONExport), specifically configured for development with Claude Code through the cloud interface.

This project provides a system for exporting Archipelago's game logic into a standardized JSON format and includes a modular web client that uses this JSON for advanced tracking, accessibility analysis, and other utilities.

**[Web Client Live Demo](https://peerinfinity.github.io/Archipelago-CC/)**

## Repository Structure & Differences from Upstream

This fork differs from the upstream repository in several key ways:

- **Main Branch Development:** Code is maintained in the `main` branch (instead of `JSONExport` branch) to simplify Claude Code cloud interface access
- **Branch Management:** Each Claude Code session creates a new branch, which are preserved for reference rather than regularly cleaned up
- **GitHub Pages Setup:**
  - Only the `frontend` directory is deployed to GitHub Pages (not the entire repository)
  - Deployed automatically via GitHub Actions on every push to `main`
  - This provides the latest version of the code (may not always be stable)
- **Upstream:** Based on [PeerInfinity/Archipelago](https://github.com/PeerInfinity/Archipelago/tree/JSONExport), which is forked from [ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago)

## Key Features

-   **A Highly-Configurable Web Client:** The entire user interface is built with Golden Layout, allowing you to drag, drop, stack, and resize panels to create a workspace that fits your exact needs.

-   **Standard Tracking Mode:** Connect to an Archipelago server just like a standard client. Load your game's `rules.json` file to enable logic-aware tracking:
    -   View which locations are accessible with your current inventory.
    -   View color-coded accessibility status (Available, Inaccessible, Checked).
    -   Explore visual trees that show the specific rules for any location or exit.
    -   Use the Path Analyzer to determine what items are needed to reach a new region.

-   **Advanced Modules & Game Modes:**
    -   **Text Adventure:** Interact with your game world through a classic text-based interface.
    -   **Iframe & Window Integration:** Host external web applications or game clients directly within a panel or in a separate window, fully connected to the main application's state.
    -   **Archipelago Loops (Incremental Game Mode):** A unique game mode inspired by idle/incremental games. Automate your playthrough, manage resources, and gain persistent knowledge to explore deeper with each loop.

-   **Rule Export System:** A Python-based tool that uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis to parse the game logic from any Archipelago world and convert it into a standardized, portable JSON format.

## Getting Started (For Users)

### Standard Mode

1.  **Generate Your Game:** To get the necessary files, generate your seed using a version of Archipelago that contains the JSON exporter tool. You can download this from the [Archipelago JSON Export fork](https://github.com/PeerInfinity/Archipelago/tree/JSONExport). When you generate a seed, you will get two important files: your `.archipelago` file (for the server) and a `rules.json` file (for this web client).
2.  **Open the Web Client:** [Open the client](https://peerinfinity.github.io/Archipelago-CC/).
3.  **Load Your Rules:** In one of the panels, find the "Presets" tab. At the top, click the "Load JSON File" button and select your `rules.json` file.
4.  **Connect:** In the "Console & Status" panel, enter your server address and click "Connect".

## For Developers

The project is composed of two main parts: the Python **exporter** and the modular **frontend web client**.

The frontend is built with modern, vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ Modules), a Web Worker-based State Manager to ensure a responsive UI, and the Golden Layout library for panel management. It features a robust, event-driven architecture that allows for extension.
