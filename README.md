# Archipelago JSON Export Tools

This project provides a system for exporting Archipelago's game logic into a standardized JSON format and includes a powerful, modular web client that uses these rules for advanced tracking and other utilities.

**[Try the Web Client Live](https://peerinfinity.github.io/Archipelago/)**

## Key Features

- **A Highly-Configurable Web Client:** The entire user interface is built with Golden Layout, allowing you to drag, drop, stack, and resize panels to create a workspace that fits your exact needs.

- **Standard Tracking Mode:** Connect to an Archipelago server just like a standard client. Load your game's `rules.json` file to unlock logic-aware tracking:

  - Instantly see which locations are accessible with your current inventory.
  - View color-coded accessibility status (Available, Inaccessible, Checked).
  - Explore visual trees that break down the specific rules for any location or exit.
  - Use the "Path Analyzer" to discover exactly what items you need to reach a new region.

- **Archipelago Loops (Incremental Game Mode):** _(Note: This mode is currently undergoing a refactor)._ A unique game mode inspired by idle/incremental games. Automate your playthrough in time loops, manage resources like Mana, and gain persistent knowledge (XP) to explore deeper with each loop.

- **Rule Export System:** A Python-based tool that uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis to parse the game logic from any Archipelago world and convert it into a standardized, portable JSON format.

## Getting Started (For Users)

### Standard Mode

1.  **Generate Your Game:** When you generate a seed, you will get two important files: your `.archipelago` file (for your game client) and a `rules.json` file (for this web client).
2.  **Open the Web Client:** [Click this link to open the client](https://peerinfinity.github.io/Archipelago/).
3.  **Load Your Rules:** In one of the default panels, find the **"Presets"** tab. At the top, click the **"Load JSON File"** button and select your `rules.json` file.
4.  **Connect:** In the **"Console & Status"** panel, enter your server address and connect.

## For Developers

The project is composed of two main parts: the Python **exporter** and the modular **frontend web client**.

The frontend is built with modern, vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ Modules), a Web Worker-based State Manager to ensure a responsive UI, and the Golden Layout library for panel management. It features a robust, event-driven architecture that allows for easy extension.
