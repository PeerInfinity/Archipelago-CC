# Rule Builder

Declarative rule definition system for Archipelago, based on [PR #5048](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/pull/5048).

## Overview

Rule Builder provides a clean, declarative API for defining game logic rules that are inherently serializable to JSON.

```python
from rule_builder import Has, HasAll, And, Or, CanReachRegion

# Define rules using builder classes
rule = Has("Sword") & Has("Shield")
rule = HasAll(["Key1", "Key2"]) | CanReachRegion("Shortcut")

# Serialize to JSON
rule_dict = rule.to_dict()

# Deserialize from JSON
rule = Rule.from_dict(rule_dict)
```

## Features

- Easy-to-use Python-first design with type safety
- Rule caching and serialization
- Logic optimization and human-readable explanations
- Custom rule support for game-specific logic
- Automatic indirect connection registration

## Source

The code in `rules.py` is from [drtchops/Archipelago](https://github.com/drtchops/Archipelago) branch [`rules-engine`](https://github.com/drtchops/Archipelago/tree/rules-engine).

## Example Implementations

These branches demonstrate Rule Builder usage in real worlds:

### TOEM (Comparison Demo)
- [Original implementation](https://github.com/drtchops/Archipelago/tree/toem-benchmark/worlds/toem_original) - Traditional lambda rules
- [Rule Builder version](https://github.com/drtchops/Archipelago/tree/toem-benchmark/worlds/toem_rule_builder) - Same world using Rule Builder

### Astalon (Real-World Usage)
- [Main campaign logic](https://github.com/drtchops/Archipelago/blob/astalon-rule-builder/worlds/astalon/logic/main_campaign.py)
- [Custom rule definitions](https://github.com/drtchops/Archipelago/blob/astalon-rule-builder/worlds/astalon/logic/custom_rules.py)

## Dependencies

This module requires Archipelago core modules:
- `BaseClasses` (CollectionState, Entrance, Item, Location, MultiWorld, Region)
- `NetUtils` (JSONMessagePart)
- `Options` (CommonOptions, Option)

It will only work when running within the Archipelago environment.
