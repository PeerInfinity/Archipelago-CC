We're currently in the process of splitting the file frontend/assets/regionUI.js into the files:
frontend/assets/regionUI.js
frontend/assets/pathAnalyzerUI.js
frontend/assets/pathAnalyzerLogic.js

frontend/assets/regionUI-old.js

Can you verify that everything important from regionUI-old.js was successfully moved to the other files?
