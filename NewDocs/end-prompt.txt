That's the end of the files you need for context.  Now here are your instructions:

Here is a description of the next changes I want to make:

----

In the region panel, on each region block, I want you to add a button labeled “Show Paths”. When the button is clicked, it will calculate the possible paths from the start location to that block’s region, and add each of these paths to the bottom of the region block. There should be a finite number of possible paths, if you don't allow any region to occur more than once in the path. But that number might be large, and so we might want to only add one path at a time, and clicking the button again would add another path into the region block. Once the button is clicked the first time, the algorithm will calculate how many possible paths there are and display it beside the “Show Paths” button. And maybe it should stop counting if it reaches 100. When the algorithm runs the first time, it could save the paths it finds to a list, so that it doesn't need to recalculate them later. Or maybe if the algorithm is quick and we don't want to waste memory, we could iterate through the algorithm until it reaches the nth path when we want it. The algorithm is deterministic. It just enumerates all possible paths that start from the start region, and don't visit any region more than once. We keep only the paths that reach our target region, and don't look for paths that continue on from the target region. The algorithm ignores whether the region is currently accessible or not. But when we display the path, we list each region in the path in order from the start region, with the region name colored green if it's currently accessible or red if it's not.

There's another feature that I want to add, that I'll want to reuse in a few places. I want to set up some reusable code so that any time a region name appears in the UI, it can be a clickable link. When the link is clicked, it opens the region panel, enables “Show all regions”, and then scrolls the view to the specified region. We could also make locations into clickable links, that also opens the region panel, enables “Show all regions”, and scrolls the view to the region that contains that location.

Do you understand what I'm asking you to do? Please ask any clarifying questions you have before you write any code.
