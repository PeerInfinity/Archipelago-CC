    Paint uses a custom location access rule system based on paint percentage calculations.
    Each location has an access rule that compares paint percentage to a threshold derived
    from the location name (e.g., "Similarity: 1.0%").

    The base exporter's cache now includes rule_target_name, so Paint's shared class method
    (PaintLocation.access_rule) gets unique cache entries per location name. This allows
    override_rule_analysis to work correctly without needing postprocess_regions.

    For WorldGen worlds, rule overrides are skipped since they have their own generated rules.
